            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A Provoſt amongſt the reſt named <hi>Le Rappiniere,</hi> accoſted them firſt, and asked with a kind of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſterial authority, What they were? The young man, I lately told you of, without moving his Turban, becauſe with one hand he held his Gun, and with the other his ſword, leaſt it ſhould flap againſt his legs, told him; They were <hi>French</hi> by Birth, Players by profeſſion, that his Theatrical name was <hi>Destiny,</hi> his old Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades <hi>Rancour,</hi> and the Gentlewoman that was rooſting like a Hen in her Neſt on the top of their bag and bagage, <hi>Cave.</hi> This fantaſtical name made ſome of the company ſmile, whereupon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60933:5"/>the young player added, that the name of <hi>Cave</hi> ought not to ſound more ridiculouſly or harſh in a wiſe mans ear, then that of Mountain, Valley, Roſe, or Thornel. The converſation ended with ſome Oaths and Cuffs, which were heard at the forepart of the Cart; occaſioned by a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Tenis Court, who without any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning had beaten the Carter, becauſe his lean Cattel had eaten very liberally of a truſs of hay that lay at the door. The noiſe was appeaſed, and the good woman of the houſe, who loved Comedies better then Prayers or Sermon, out of her more then common generoſity, told the Car-man he might let his beaſts eat their fill. He willingly accepted her proffer, and while his Cattel were feeding the Authour repos'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſtudied what ſhould be the ſubject of the ſecond Chapter.</p>

                  <p> The deplorable ſucceſs of the Play.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN all the ſubordinate Towns of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, there is commonly a Tennis Court, where the idler ſort of people flock together; ſome to play, and others to look on or bet. In theſe places it is, where they curſe and ſwear frequently, riming ſo richly on the name of God, there they ſpare neither friend nor foe in their diſcourſe, murthering the reputation of their abſent neighbours with their poiſonous tongues; they give quarter to none, but treat mankind like <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted to ſcoff and raillie, according to the Talent he is Maſter of. It is in one of theſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60933:7"/>Tennis-courts, as I remember, that I left three Comical Perſons, reciting <hi>Mariana</hi> before a Right Honourable Audience, of which <hi>la Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piniere</hi> was chief; at the ſame inſtant when <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> and <hi>Mariana</hi> were contending, the two young men, from whom they had taken the Sutes ſo freely, came into the Chamber in their Drawers, each having his Racket in hand. They had neglected their being rub'd, for haſt to ſee the Comedy; they ſoon knew their own clothes worn by <hi>Pherore</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> and the moſt cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick of the two, turning towards the Marker: Son of a Bitch, ſaid he, wherefore didſt thou lend my clothes to that Puppet-player? The poor fellow, knowing what a rugged Blade he was, replies with all humility, that it was not he. And who was it then, you Cuckold Squire, added he? He durſt not accuſe <hi>la Rappiniere</hi> to his face, but he himſelf, who was the moſt inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent perſon in the World, riſing a little out of his Chair, ſaid, It was I, what have you to ſay to me? That you are a Sot, replyed the other, giving him an unmerciful rap over the Pate with his Racket. <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> was ſo amazed with his being prevented by this blow, which was the advantage he ever uſed to take of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that he remained immovable, either out of admiration, or becauſe he was not yet heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enough in his Harneſs; for he could not be eaſily provoked to venture his Carcaſe, though it were only at Cuffs; and perhaps the Quarrel had ended there, if his Man, who had more ſpirit than the Maſter, had not fallen upon the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60933:7"/>Aſſailant with a ſmart blow on his face attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all its circumſtances, and followed it at random with a number of others. <hi>La Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piniere</hi> ſet upon him in the Rear, and began to belabour him with all his might, as being moſt concern'd: A Kinſman of his Adverſaries flies on <hi>la Rappiniere,</hi> after the ſame manner, he was engaged by a friend of <hi>la Rappinieres</hi> to make a diverſion; this laſt was aſſaulted by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he by another likewiſe: In the end, all in the Chamber were engaged, one ſwore, the other rail'd, and all ſcuffled bravely: The Woman of the houſe finding her houſhold-ſtuff going to wrack, filled the Air with her pitiful out-cries; to ſay the truth, they were all in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of periſhing with flinging of Chairs, and Forms, and giving Kicks and Cuffs, if ſome of the Magiſtrates of the Town, who were paſſing by with the Sheriff, had not come up at the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum. Some were of opinion to throw two or three Pales of Water among them, to cool their courage; and this remedy might perhaps have proved effectual, had they not parted out of pure laſſitude: Beſides that two, Father <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins</hi> moved with charity came upon the ſpot, and made, not a firm peace, but a kinde of Truce, in which interim they might treat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice taking an account of either party.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60933:8"/>was particularly engaged, and ſo ſhrewdly bang'd, as he did many others, that they were quickly forc'd to leave the Field. He loſt the Plaiſter from his face during the Skirmiſh, which diſcovered a face, as handſome as the ſhape of his body. The bloody muzles were waſhed with cold water, the torn bands were changed, ſome at a plaſmes were applyed, the rent clothes were ſtitched up, the houſhold-ſtuff marſhalled in due place, but not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo whole as in the beginning of the Fray. In fine, ſome moments after there remained no ſignes of any Combate, but only a little ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity was legible in their countenances. The poor Players went out a good while after with <hi>la Rappiniere,</hi> who would needs have the laſt word: As they went croſs the Market, they were ſurrounded by ſeven or eight Bravo's, with Weapons in hand; <hi>le Rappiniere</hi> as he was wont, grew very fearful, and had found cauſe form, had not <hi>Deſtiny</hi> moſt generouſly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd and put by a Thruſt which had run tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row him; which nevertheleſs he could not ſo abſolutely avoid, but he received a ſleight wound in his Arm: He drew his Sword upon this, and in a very ſhort time, forced two of theirs out of their hands, open'd one or two of their Skulls, ſliced their Ears, and ſo Nobly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the Ambuſcade of theſe <hi>Monſieurs,</hi> that al the Spectators proteſted they never ſaw ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant a Champion. This routed Party, was ſet on <hi>la Rappiniere</hi> by two young Gallants; one whereof had married his Siſter, who began the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60933:8"/>Fray with his Racket: And it is very probable <hi>la Rappiniere</hi> had been ſpoil'd, had not fortune raiſed him this valiant Comedian for Deſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. This good turn ſomwhat ſoftned his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heart; ſo that not enduring this poor ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Remnant of a broken Company ſhould be forced to quarter at an Inn, he invited them to his own houſe, where the Carter unloaded their Players trumpery, and return'd back to his native Village.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>MIſtreſs <hi>la Rappiniere</hi> received the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with great civility, being a woman that ſubmitted her ſelf more freely than any other; ſhe was not ugly, though ſo lean and dry, that ſhe never ſnuffed a Candle with her fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers end, but they took fire: I could relate a hundred rare ſtories, which I omit, as being too prolix. In half an hour the two women were ſo well acquainted, that they had no other Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but my Deareſt, and my Joy, at every turn. <hi>La Rappiniere,</hi> who was as full of vain-glory, as any finical Barber in the town, bid them at his firſt coming home, repair to the Kitching and Larder, and charge the Officers to haſten Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60933:9"/>This was a pure <hi>Rodomontado,</hi> for beſides an antient Groom that kept his Horſe, he had no other ſervants but a young wench, and an old hobling Chair-woman as ſickly as a decai'd Bitch. But his pride had a fall, by an accident that befel him: He ordinarily ate at the Inns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other Prodigal young fools charges, and his Family at home ſo well regulated, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Cabbige, and Pottage according to the cuſtom of the Countrey; deſiring to appear like ſome body before his Gueſts, and regale them with extraordinaries, he thought to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd ſome money to his man behind his back, wherewith to purchaſe a treat: But whether it were the ſervants, or the Maſters fault, I know not how, the money falls gingling down upon the arm of his Chair where he ſat, and from thence to the ground; <hi>la Rappiniere</hi> look'd very blew upon it, his Wife bluſh'd, <hi>Rancour</hi> did not mind it, the ſervant ſwore, and <hi>Cave</hi> ſmil'd; but as for <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> I cannot now tell what effect it wrought upon his ſpirit. Well —the money was gathered up again, and whilſt the Supper was providing, they entred into converſation. <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> ask'd <hi>Deſtiny</hi> wherefore he diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his face with a Plaiſter: He told him there was Reaſon enough, for being accidentally forc'd to make his eſcape in thoſe uncouth clothes, he was willing to hide his face from the knowledge of his Enemies, by keeping it under that cloud. In the end, the Supper, ſuch as it was, came in; <hi>la Rappiniere</hi> drunk till he was fudled, and <hi>Rancour</hi> was up to the Hilts in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60933:9"/>blood of <hi>Pacchus; Deſtiny</hi> eat very ſoberly like a temporate man, <hi>Cave</hi> like a famiſh'd Player, and Miſtreſs <hi>la Rappiniere</hi> as a woman that took advantage of the preſent opportunity; that is to ſay, till ſhe was over-gorg'd. Whileſt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſervants were feeding, and the beds making ready, <hi>la Rappiniere</hi> tired them with a thouſand frivolous ſtories. <hi>Deſtiny</hi> lay alone in a little private Chamber, <hi>Cave</hi> with the young Wench in a by-cloſer, and <hi>Rancour</hi> I know not where, with the ſerving-man. They had all a great mind to ſleep, ſome for wearineſs, the other with repletion; and yet they ſlept but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little, ſo uncertain is every thing in this world. After her firſt ſlumber, Miſtriſs <hi>la Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piniere</hi> had a mind to do that which no body could do for her, her Husband wak'd immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after ſhe was gone, though he were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently drunk ſtill, and finding he was left alone he called his Wife, but was not anſwered; this bred a jealouſie, his jealouſie made him mad, and this madneſs made him riſe in an inſtant. Going out of his Chamber, he hears ſomthing trampling juſt before him; a while he ſteals af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it: And in the midſt of a little Entry, that led to <hi>Deſtiny</hi>'s Chamber, he found himſelf ſo near the Party he traced, that he was ready to tread on the heels of it; he thought to lay hands upon his Wife, and ſeizes upon it crying out, <hi>Ah you Whore!</hi> But he graſp'd nothing but Air; while his feet meeting a ſtumbling-block, down comes he with his Noſe on the floor, where ſome ſharp thing punch'd his breaſt ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately;

                  <hi>RAncour</hi> the <hi>Comedian,</hi> one of the principal <hi>Hero</hi>'s of our <hi>Romance,</hi> (for we ſhall have more then one in this Book) and ſince nothing is more compleat then a Romantique <hi>Hero,</hi> half a Dozen at leaſt, or ſuch as ſhall lay claim to that Title, ſhall render mine more accompliſh'd then a ſingle one can do, who perhaps is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domeſt mention'd, there being nothing but right and wrong in this World. This <hi>Rancour</hi> then, was one of thoſe <hi>Miſanthropes</hi> that hated every one elſe, and ſcarce loved themſelves: and I have been told by many that they never ſaw him laugh. He had wit enough, and made ill Rhyms well enough, otherwiſe a man of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in ſome degree, as malicious as an old Ape, and envious as a Dog; He found ſome fault with every one of his profeſſion, <hi>Relleroze</hi> was too affected, <hi>Mondory</hi> ſtarch'd and ſtiff, <hi>Floridor</hi> baſhful, and ſo forwards; nay, I believe he would have had it thought himſelf was the only compleat Actor, though in truth, they had not kept him then in the Company, but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had ſerved a double apprentiſhip in the Trade. In thoſe times when they were confin'd ro <hi>H</hi>—s Plays, he imitated, a woman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60933:11"/>part behind a vizard: but afterwards when the Stage advanc'd to higher perfection, he plaid ſomtimes the Conſtables Deputy, or a Confident, an Ambaſſadour, or Herald, when any War-like or Tragical buſineſs was the Theam, or made up one at the lewd ſinging of a Drunken catch, ſomtimes appearing with a Mealy Viſage to carry on a merry farce. With theſe plauſible Talents he laid the foundation of inſupportable pride, which being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with his perpetual raillery, eternal back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting, and a quarrelſome humour, ſomtimes carried on with a little flaſhy valour, made him ſomwhat feared by his aſſociates; onely to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny</hi> he was quiet as a Lamb, and behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as rationally as his nature would ſuffer him. Some would ſay that he had been cudgel'd, but that report quickly vaniſh'd, as well as the other of his being ſo greedy of Money as to pad for it, but for all this, we muſt allow him to be as honeſt a man as lived. I related, as I remember, that he was lodg'd with <hi>La Rappinieres</hi> ſervant, whoſe name was <hi>Doguin;</hi> whether the bed were not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie enough, or whether <hi>Doguin</hi> were no good bed-fellow, I know not, but he could not ſleep all the night.

The Merchant gives it him as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly as at firſt; <hi>Rancour</hi> holds it to the place out of which we uſe to piſs, but with as little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to piſs, as to let the Merchant reſt in quiet: he cries out louder then before, and was twice as long not piſſing, conjuring the Merchant not to trouble himſelf any more with reaching the Pot, telling him it was unreaſonable, and he would make a ſhift to do it well enough him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: The poor man, who would at that time have given half his eſtate to have fetch'd out his ſleep, drouzily told him, he might do as he pleaſed; and ſet the pot down again. They bid each other good night very civilly, and the poor Merchant would have ventured a good wager, that he ſhould now ſleep as quietly as ever he did in his life: <hi>Rancour</hi> who knew what would happen, lets him fairly engage himſelf a while to a moſt ſweet repoſe, and making no conſcience of waking him, he lays his ſharp el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow juſt upon the pit of his ſtomach, and throwing his whole body forwards, ſtretches his arme out of the bed, as we uſe to doe to take up any thing from the bed-ſide; The Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Merchant ſtart up awake, feeling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf almoſt ſtifled and preſt to death, crying out horribly with an oath, O Sir you kill me! <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour</hi> replies with as much ſoftneſs, as the other
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60933:14"/>ſpake with paſſion: I beg your pardon, I was only going to reach the Pot. Ah! cri'd the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I had rather watch'd the whole night and given it you my ſelf, for you have done that to me, which I ſhall carry to my Grave. <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour</hi> made him no anſwer, but piſſed ſo copiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with ſo much ſtrength, that this noiſe alone had been ſufficient to have awaked the Merchant. He filled the Pot up to the brim, bleſſing god with a Phanitical Hipocriſie: The poor Merchant congratulated as well as he could the emptying of his bladder, and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ejaculation of Urine, which made him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe himſelf an uninterrupted ſleep, when the curſed <hi>Rancour</hi> making as if he would ſet down the pot again, let both it and the piſs fall down upon the gentlemans Face, Beard, and Breaſt, crying out, Alas! Sir, I entreat your pardon; The Merchant made no return to his civility, for as ſoon as he felt himſelf pickled in that liquor, he roſe up howling like a Fury, and bawling for a Candle. <hi>Rancour</hi> with a moſt cunning calmneſs, ſaid, faith this is an unlucky accident; but the Merchant continued his cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. The Hoſt, Hoſteſs, Tapſters and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bermaids, took the Alarum and came to them, the Merchant telling them they had brought him the Devil for a bed-fellow, called for a fire in another Room. They demanded what he ailed, but his anger was ſo unexpreſſible he gave no reply, but caught up his Cloaths and Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manteau, and went into the Kitchen to dry himſelf, where he ſlept out the reſt of the night
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60933:15"/>on a bench by the fire-ſide: The Maſter of the Houſe enquired of <hi>Rancour</hi> what the matter was, who told him with a counterfeit ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: I cannot imagine what reaſon he ſhould have to complain: but he ſtarted out of his ſleep, and waked me at the ſame time with a hideous out-cry of murther, ſo that either ſome fearful dream diſturbed him, or elſe he muſt needs be diſtracted, for he hath be-piſſed the bed till it is all on float again; the good woman felt the bed with her hand, and found it ſo true, that ſhe ſwore by her maker ſhe would make him pay for his naſtineſs: They wiſh'd <hi>Rancour</hi> a good night, who ſlept as quietly till morning, as if he had had the cleareſt conſcience in the world and ſo recruited himſelf of the diſturbance his Carcaſs had met with the precedent night at <hi>Rappinieres:</hi> He was rouzed ſomwhat earlier though then he intended, <hi>Rappinieres</hi> maid, calling him up in great haſt, to come and ſpeak with <hi>Doguin</hi> who was dying, and deſired to ſee him before he left the world: He went not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome trouble, being puzled to gueſs what might be the occaſion of this fellows ſending for him at ſuch a time, having had no acquaintance with him but the day before.

When our Players were come together in a Chamber, moſt of the vagrant Town Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flies flock'd into their preſence, amongſt which ſome were unſatisfied at their cold reception. They all began to diſcourſe of Plays, Poetry and renowned Authors of <hi>Romances:</hi> never was more noiſe made in any Chamber, unleſs at a Quarrel. And above all the reſt, the Poet with a ring of admirers about him of the chiefeſt wits of the Town, was tearing his throat with tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them he had ſeen <hi>Corneille,</hi> had drunk many a quart with Saint <hi>Amant</hi> and <hi>Beys,</hi> and loſt a good friend by the death of <hi>Rotrou.</hi> Madam <hi>Cave,</hi> and Madam <hi>Angellica</hi> her daughter, were laying their cloaths in order, with as little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern as if no body had been in the room. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicas</hi> hands were ſomtimes ſqueez'd or kiſs'd, for thoſe Country gentlemen are great fumblers and ſlabberers; But ſhe quickly found the way to be delivered from the perſecution by a timely kick on their ſhins, a cuff, or a bite according as the preſent neceſſity required. It was not out of any rudneſs or want of breeding, but her

Madam <hi>Star</hi> was of a quite contrary temper, the world yields not a modeſter girl, or of a milder nature, and ſo great was her complaiſance that ſhe had not the power to free her ſelf from that impertinent crew, though ſhe endured a great deal of pain by her ſore leg, and wanted a little more reſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her joging journey. She lay on the bed in her cloaths, beſieged by four or five of the moſt finical Gallants, who had no more wit but to laugh at their own clinches, which made her ſomtimes ſmile at them, whereas they gueſſed ſhe was taken with their dry jeſts: And indeed, amongſt other inconveniencies belonging to that profeſſion, beſides the being forced ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to laugh when they could rather weep, it is none of the leaſt to be obliged to comply with every new vampt gentleman, as Players are wont to doe, and to be treated ſomtimes like Queens and Empereſſes, and a moment after uſed like Kitchen-maids, to be called fair and beautiful, young and ſprightly, when perhaps their tougues that proclaim it, are the onely painters that make them ſo, unleſs ſomtimes they get a recruit of new Teeth, Perriwigs and Pomatums that can hide their own defects un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe Auxilliary Adornments.

The other Gentlemen who in civility had retired to a becoming diſtance, came again to him. He told them what had paſſed, and ſhewed them the Ring ſhe beſtowed on him, which was of a conſiderable value. Whereupon every man gave his opinion, and <hi>Don Carlos</hi> was as much ſmitten with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Lady, as if he had ſeen her face, ſo much dominion and influence hath anothers wit, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe that are endued with it themſelves. Eight tedious days and more tedious nights did he linger out, without any news of this appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; How he reſented it I cannot certainly tell. But it was his daily cuſtom to divert himſelf at the lodgings of a certain Captains of a Foot Company, where many perſons of quality re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to wear away the time at play. One night, in which he, not having plaid, retired himſelf more early then he us'd ordinarily to do; he was called by his name, from a lower Chamber of a great houſe; he drew neer the wind ore, and obſerved it was fenced with Iron grates, as that Country faſhion is, and by the voice, diſcovered perfectly it was his Inviſible Lady, who ſaid to him, <hi>Come hither</hi> Don Carlos, <hi>I here wait for you, to make an end of that difference which is betwixt us. You are but a Trifler,</hi> replies <hi>Don Carlos, you defie with inſolence, then hide your

We ſhall have a neerer meeting in good time,</hi> added ſhe, <hi>it is not want of courage that makes we delay the encounter; but a deſire to know you thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, before I appear openly; You know in Duels, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties meet with equall Armes, and if your heart were not as diſingag'd as mine, then would you fight with advantage, and therefore I reſolved to be first well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd: And what have you diſcovered by your infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation?</hi> Said Don Carlos. <hi>That we may be a fit match for each other,</hi> replies the inviſible Lady. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> anſwered betwixt jeſt and earneſt, <hi>that there was no equality in that management;</hi> for ſays he, <hi>you ſee me, and know who I am, and I can neither ſee nor attain to any knowledg of you; What conjecture can I make of the care you take to conceal your ſelf? ſince thoſe whoſe deſignes are fair and noble ſcorn to hide themſelves; One that ſtands open without a guard as I do may eaſily be trappan'd: But pray take notice Lady, I ſhall not be apt to fall twice in the ſame ſnare; If you make uſe of me onely to create ſome jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie in another, give me leave to tell you that I am no fit inſtrument for any ſach purpoſe, therefore if I muſt ſerve you, it ſhall be only in loving you above the world or any other intereſt.

He knew very well, that there were in <hi>Naples</hi> divers Princeſſes and Ladies of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but he bethought himſelf likewiſe how many greedy Courteſans there were too, nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble crafty, and catching after ſtrangers, who were the more dangerous, becauſe they are beautiful. I cannot exactly tell you, whether he had ſup'd that night, or went to bed empty, as ſome Romance-mongers uſe to do, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate all their <hi>Hero</hi>'s actions making them riſe early, and tell on their begun ſtory till dinner time, then dine lightly, and after meal, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the diſcourſe, or elſe retire to ſome ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Grove to talk by themſelves, unleſs they have ſomthing to diſcover to the Rocks and Trees: Then at ſupper time, meet at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

But to return to my ſtory, <hi>Don Carlos</hi> came the next day to his Poſt, and found the Inviſible already at hers; She asked him <hi>whether he was not very much perplexed at their laſt converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and whether in truth he were not in a kinde of doubt of every thing ſhe told him. Don Carlos,</hi> not making any anſwer to theſe queſtions, beſeeched her to tell him, what danger could accrue by diſcovering her ſelf, ſince the parties were equal, and their Courtſhip tended to the ſame end on either ſide, which the whole world could not but approve: <hi>There is danger enough, as you ſhall Jully know in due time</hi> reply'd the Inviſible, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore once more let me deſire you to believe I am real, and have kept my ſelf within bounds in the relation I made you of my ſelf. Don Carlos</hi> preſſed her no farther in that particular; their diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a good while, and they both took deeper and ſtronger impreſſions of love towards each other, then they had done before, parting with hearty promiſes of a continuance of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and a daily meeting at the place aſſign'd. The day following there was a grand Ball at the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60933:24"/>
                  <hi>Vice-Roys; Don Carlos</hi> hoped to diſcover his Lady there; and in the mean while, endeavoured to make enquiry whoſe houſe that was, where he had ſuch a favourable audience. He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the houſe was an old Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans that lived very retired, the Widdow of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain, who had neither Daughters nor Neece. He intreated to ſpeak with her, ſhe returned him an anſwer, <hi>That ſince the death of her Husband ſhe admitted no viſits,</hi> which put him into a greater labyrinth then before.</p>
               <p>But he puts on a gallant reſolution, and at night was at the Vice-Roys <hi>Bal,</hi> where you may imagine there was a brave appearance. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> took exact notice of all the Ladies in the preſence, to judge which might be his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Miſtris. He made his Addreſs to all thoſe, he could conveniently talk with, but found it labour loſt: At laſt he applyed himſelf to the Daughter of a Marqueſs, of I know not what Marqueſate, as they ſay, (for it is that of all things in the world I ſhould leaſt ſwear for, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially now every one is a Marqueſs, at leſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles himſelf ſo;) She was both young and beautifull, and had ſomewhat the tone of her voice whom he hunted for: but at the long run, he found ſo little reſemblance in the behaviour, and wit of this Lady, and his inviſible Lover, that he repented he had made ſo great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in his Court-ſhip with this Lady, as might without flattery give him ſome claim to her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. They often danced together, and the <hi>Bal</hi> being ended, with very little ſatisfaction to

                  <hi>Don Carlos;</hi> he parted from his Captive, who was not a little proud that ſhe alone had enjoy'd in that Glorious Aſſembly, the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of a Perſon, that was the envy of all other men for his gallantry, and the highlieſt Eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all Women. From the <hi>Bal</hi> he returned haſtily to his own lodging to take his Sword, and from thence to the Fata<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His Lady was at the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, who asked him what news of the <hi>Bal,</hi> though ſhe her ſelf had been there: He told her ingeniouſly, that he had danced many times with a very beautifull perſon, and had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her all the time the <hi>Bal</hi> laſted. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe made ſeverall doubtfull queſtions, which plainly betrayed a kind of jealouſie. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> made her know, that he had ſome ſcruple likewiſe, for her not appearing at the <hi>Bal,</hi> which made him a little ſuſpicious, whether ſhe were of the quality ſhe had pretended: She diſcovers it, and to ſatisfie him, ſhe makes uſe of all her charms, became very complaiſant, and ſhewed him as much favour as could be expreſſed in communication thorow a Grate, even ſo far as to aſſure him, ſhe would be ſhortly viſible. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they take leave of each other, he much in doubt whether he ſhould credit her or no, and ſhe a little ſtung with jealouſie, for his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo aſſiduouſly kept company with the fair Lady all the while the <hi>Bal</hi> laſted.

He would have followed, but was ſtoped at the Church door, by an eminent Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who kept him there a good ſpace in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60933:26"/>diſcourſe, which he could no way avoid. The reſt of the day he waſted in admiration of what hapned, and at firſt his thoughts perſwaded him it was the ſame Lady he met at the <hi>Bal,</hi> that made this diſcovery to him, but then reflecting on this Ladies wit, and the others want of it, he knew not where to fix his belief, and could have almoſt wiſhed he were diſ-ingaged from his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Miſtris, to reſign himſelf intirely up to this new one: Yet then conſidering again, he was as far from knowing the laſt as the firſt, whoſe charming converſation had wholly enchained him, he reſolved on his former choice, not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing her threatning ſpeeches to obſtruct him, as not being a perſon of ſo poor and groveling a ſpirit to be frighted from any thing he once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned. The ſame night he failed not to appear at the Grate, at his aſſigned hour, nor did four men, who lay in wait for him, fail to ceaze on him in the midſt of his diſcourſe, who ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd and lifted him into a Coach, that attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the turning of the next ſtreet. Now muſt I leave you to imagine what language and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches he beſtowed on thoſe diſguiſed fellows that thus took him at ſo much diſadvantage; and when that heat could do no good, then he endeavoured to bribe them with large promiſes: but inſtead of perſwading them, all he could do, rather made them the more reſolute, and wary leaſt he ſhould eſcape, which they performed ſo effectually, as took away all hope of gaining his liberty, either by his intreaties or courage. Mean time the Coach rowled away as faſt as
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60933:27"/>four Fleet Horſes could hurry it; Out of Town they got, and about an hour after they brought him into a very ſumptuous building, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Gate ſtanding ready open to receive him, where the four <hi>Maſcarades</hi> alighted with <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> and taking him under the armes, led him like an Ambaſſadour to his Audience before the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> they conducted him up one pair of ſtayres with the ſame Ceremony, where two Masked Ladies received him at the Dining-room door with lights in their hands. The men left him there at liberty, and withdrew, after they had moſt humbly ſaluted him.

Neither can I tell you whether the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks the two Women held were of Silver or not, but this I muſt aſſure you, they were large, and A la Mode, and the Dining-room moſt Magnificent, and if you pleaſe, as well furniſhed as ſome of thoſe Apartments in our Modern Romances, <hi>(viz.)

Had he been of <hi>Don Quixots</hi> humour, theſe adventures were enough to have tranſported him to ſome extravagance, ſuitable to his <hi>Rodomontado</hi>'s, and he would ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have fancied himſelf at leaſt <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> or <hi>Amadis:</hi> But our grave <hi>Spaniard</hi> was no more moved with all this, then if he had onely been in ſome common Inn, or Country Cottage; only he regretted the abſence of his inviſible Miſtris, and having all his thoughts fixed on her, he thought that Room more melancholly then a Priſon which never looks handſome but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſide. He readily perſwaded himſelf, they could intend no miſchief that had ſo nobly lodged him; and was as apt to believe the Lady that talked with him the preceding day in the Chappel, was the Sorcereſs that wrought all theſe Enchantments: a while after, he began to admire in his own thoughts at theſe caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humours in Women, and with what expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they execute thoſe deſigns they have once on foot, but was no leſs reſolv'd on his part likewiſe, patiently to expect the end of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, and to keep conſtant to his Miſtris at the Grate, whatever threats or promiſes they could make uſe of to undermine his faith. Some time after, certain Officers belonging to the Houſe, with Vizards and Rich Cloaths on, came in to lay the cloath, which done, Supper was

The Muſick laſted a while after Supper was done, and every one being retired, <hi>Don Carlos</hi> walked up and down the room a good ſpace, ruminating on all theſe Enchantments, or on ſomewhat elſe, which matters not much, and then without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring whether he deſired to go to bed, two Gentlewomen masked, and a little Dwarf with his vizard on likewiſe, came to undreſs him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after they had ſpread a moſt ſumptuous Toillet on a ſide Table. He freely ſubmitted to all this, the Women laid down the Bed-cloaths and went forth, the Dwarf pull'd off his Shooes or Boots, and then diſroab'd him. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> laid him down in Bed, and all this paſſed without breaking ſilence in the leaſt on either part. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> ſlept well enough for a Lover; a vollery of Birds not far from his window waked him at day-break, the mask'd Dwarf was ready to wait on him, and brought him the fineſt, whiteſt, and ſweeteſt ſcented Linnen in the World: But let us, if you pleaſe omit how he paſs'd the time till Dinner, which was not inferiour to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and proceed to the breach of that religious

Perhaps my Rival by her wiles, and the good fortune of having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted you firſt, is already in full poſſeſſion of that Fort, your heart, to which I now lay ſiedge: But know a Woman will not be put off at firſt denial, and if my fortune which is not to be deſpiſed, and all that may be had with me, is but too weak a motive to induce you to love me, yet know that I have this ſelf ſatisfaction, that I did not obſcure my ſelf either out of ſhame or policy, rather chuſing to run the hazzard of being denyed for my imperfection, then to have won your Love by Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> With theſe words ſhe took off her mask, and gave <hi>Don Carlos</hi> a full view of Heaven, or if you pleaſe, an Epitomy of it, in the lovelieſt Head in the World, ſuſtained by a body of the nobleſt ſtature he ever had beheld.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60933:29"/>at length, after an interiour conflict, which held him ſo long in ſuſpence, as put the Lady of the Enchanted Palace to ſome trouble, he took a fixed reſolution to reveal the ſecrets of his ſoul, which was, it may be, the moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous action he ever performed. The anſwer he made was this, which ſome have judged might have been better contrived. <hi>I cannot deny Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, but it would have been too tranſcendent a happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for me to have thus pleaſed you, could I have been but ſo happy likewiſe as that I might have loved you. I am ſenſible that I refuſe the most Beautifull Perſon in the World, for another, that perhaps is onely ſo in my imagination: But Madam, could you have thought me worthy of your Affection, if you had found me capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Infidelity? And could I continue faithfull if I ſhould yield to love you? Pitry me therefore Madam, rather then accuſe me, or rather let us bemoan each other, you, that you cannot obtain your wiſhes, and I, that I cannot become ſo fortunate as to get the least ſight of her I Adore.</hi> He pronounced this with ſo mournful an accent, that the Lady eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned his heart went along with his tongue. She omitted no Arguments that might perſwade him to change, but he was deaf at her prayers, and her tears could not force him to relent; ſhe repeated her Aſſaults divers times, but he Defended as well as ſhe Attack'd: In fine, ſhe proceeded to reproaches, and bitter language, and utter'd;
<q>
                     <l>All that a raging mouth ſpits forth,</l>
                     <l>When Choller is praedominant.</l>

                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:60933:30"/>And ſo left him curſing his own misfortunes a thouſand times, which ſprung but from his too great happineſs. A Gentlewoman came and told him ſhortly after, that he might take his own liberty to walk if he pleaſed, in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.

                  <hi>Don Carlos</hi> was ſo raviſhed to receive this news from his Lady, with whom he was heartily in love, that he kiſt the paper a hundred times, and returned to the Garden gate to finde out the happy Meſſenger, on whom he beſtowed a very fair Diamond Ring for recompence. He continued his walk in the Garden a long time after, and could not enough admire this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Porcia,</hi> of whom he had often heard ſpeak, as a perſon both young and very rich, as being of one of the beſt Families in the Kingdom; and having a great deal of virtue in himſelf it begat ſo ſtrange an averſion in his thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, that he reſolved at the hazard of his life, to do his utmoſt to make his eſcape thence. As he came out of the Garden, he met a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman unmasked, for now all their Masks were thrown by in the Palace, who deſired to be informed whether it would be pleaſing to him to have her Ladies company at his Table that day; I leave it to your diſcretion to judge, whether he ſaid he ſhould be glad of the honour or not. Soon after, ſupper or dinner was brought in, I have forgot now which is next in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60933:31"/>order. <hi>Porcia</hi> appeared yet fairer, I told you even now, then <hi>Cytherea,</hi> and for diverſity it will not be amiſs at preſent to ſay then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant morning, or the beauteous <hi>Aurora.</hi> She was ſo charming in her converſation at Table, and ſo full of wu, that it was an inward trouble to him, to find ſo many excellent talents ſo ill employed by a Lady of her extraordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. He endeavoured all he could to put himſelf into a pleaſant humour, though his beſt thoughts were ſtill rowing after his Inviſible Miſtris, and his heart earn'd to be talking again with her at the grate. As ſoon as they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, the attendants left them alone, and <hi>Don Carlos</hi> ſitting mute, either out of reſpect, or to oblige the Lady to begin the diſcourſe, ſhe gives him a freſh charge in theſe words. <hi>I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell whether I have reaſon to hope for any thing from the gayety which I think I have read in your countenance, or if the little beauty I have diſcovered in mine, can be ſo conſiderable in your opinion, as to create a doubt whether that which is ſo ſlily conceal'd from you, is likely to be more tempting; I have not hid the gift I would have beſtowed, becauſe you ſhould have no cauſe to repent the acceptance, and though a perſon who daily recieves Petitions from others, might juſtly take offence at ſuch denials, yet ſhall I forbear all further reſentments, if you will now at laſt but make me reparations for your former neglect, and grant that to me, which is much more my due, then the Inviſible Ladies? let me therefore know your laſt reſolution, that if it prove not to my advantage, I may on my part
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60933:31"/>likewiſe endeavour to muſter up ſuch arguments from my own reaſon, as may convince me of the weakneſs I have betrayed in owning a love for you. Don Carlos</hi> pauſed a while to try whether ſhe would proceed in her diſcourſe, but perceiving ſhe had given over, and with her eye fixed on the ground, waited for the ſentance he was to pronounce, he perſiſted in the reſolution he had already ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to deal frankly with her, and to put her paſt all hopes of ever becoming hers, he thus ſpake to her. Madam, <hi>Before I return any poſitive anſwer to what you are thus deſirous to know, I muſt beg you would, with the ſame freenes I have hitherto ſhew'd, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the real ſentiments of your heart concerning what I ſhall propoſe. If your ſelf had obliged any one to love you, and by all the favours a Lady can beſtow, without forfeiting her modeſty or diſcretion, you had engaged him to vow himſelf your unalterable ſlave, would you not eſteem him the moſt treacherous and baſeſt of men, if he ſhould break his faith and decline your ſervice? and ſhould not I be this vile unworthy wretch, if to obtain you, I ſhould throw off my willing fetters and trample on all thoſe nob'e endearments which juſtly makes her expect I ſhould continue faithfull in my love to her, to put on other Chains.</hi> He would have hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped many other formal Arguments to convince her; but ſhe allowed him not the time, for ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing briskly up, ſhe told him; <hi>She now perceived plainly at what he aymed, and could not but admire his constancy, though it were a Virtue ſo prejudicial to her own happineſs, wherefore ſhe left him to his full liberty from that moment, onely ſhe ſhould value it as a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60933:32"/>high favour if he would remain there till it were night, that he might return incognito as he came.</hi> While ſhe ſaid this, ſhe held a Hand-cherchif before her eyes, as it were to hide her tears, and left the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſomewhat amazed, but yet ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed for the recovery of his liberty, that he could not have diſſembled it, though he had been the greateſt hypocrite in the world; and it is probable if the Lady had obſerved it, it could not have avoided a freſh quarrell. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell whether the night were long a coming, for as I hinted before, I do not trouble my ſelf any more with ſuch punctual obſervations of the times and hours; I ſhall only ſay, that the night did come at laſt, and he was put into a cloſe Coach, which brought him to his own Lodging again, after a pretty good journey. And being one of the kindeſt Maſters in the World, his Servants were overcome with joy, to ſee him again, and like to ſtifle him with huging him in their armes; but they enjoyed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence only a moment, for taking his Sword and Piſtols, and two of his Acquaintance with him, who were not people to be baffled, he made all poſſible haſt to his Grate, and ſuch was his ſpeed that thoſe who were to accompany him, had much adoe to keep pace with him. He had no ſooner made the accuſtomed ſignal, but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Deity anſwered him. They had a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſuch tender and affectionate expreſſions, as draws ſome tears into my eyes every time I think on them: At length, the Inviſible Lady ſaid, <hi>That ſhe having received a ſenſible affront in the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60933:32"/>houſe where ſhe then was, ſhe had ſent for a Coach to remove thence; but becauſe it might be perhaps too long ere hers came, ſhe intreated he would cauſe his own to be made quickly ready for the better diſpatch, and ſend for it to convey her to a place where ſhe intended to throw off all diſguiſe, and hide her face no longer from him.</hi> The impatient lover ſtay'd not for any more entreaty, but ran like one tranſported to his Servants, or Compagnons, whom he had left at the corner of the ſtreet, and ſent them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to bring his Coach. The Coach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived, the Fair Inviſible made her words good, and went into it with him. She gave the directions her ſelf to the Coachman whither he ſhould go, and made him ſtop at a Great Houſe into which they went, by Torch-light, where many at the Gate waited their coming. The Gallant went up a large pair of ſtairs with the Lady, and ſo into an upper Dining-Room, where he continued ſtill in ſome trouble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe kept on her Mask. At laſt ſeveral Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen richly apparelled, being come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, with Wax Candles in their hands; the Lady threw off her Inviſibility, and by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masking her ſelf, made it apparent to <hi>Don Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los,</hi> that his Miſtris at the Grate, and the Princeſs <hi>Porcia</hi> was but the ſame perſon. I ſhall not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to repreſent the ſtrange ſurprize it was to <hi>Don Carlos;</hi> The Beautifull <hi>Neapolitan</hi> told him, <hi>That ſhe had brought him now away the ſecond time, to hear his final reſolution, that the Lady at the Grate had yielded up all pretenſes to her ſelf;</hi> to which ſhe added a thouſand other Gallant Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60933:33"/>Speeches. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> fell down at her feet, Embraced her knees, and even devoured her white hands with his greedy kiſſing them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by avoiding the many impertinent expreſſions which overjoy'd people are apt to fall into. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his firſt tranſports were over, he fummon'd all the Wit and Eloquence he could command to celebrate his Ladies pleaſant contrivances, and tuned his tongue ſo well to her advantage and applauſe, that it confirmed her more and more, ſhe was not at all miſtaken in her choice. She told him withall, <hi>She had been unwilling to trust any but her ſelf, in a tryal, without which ſhe could never have loved him, and that ſhe would never have bestow'd her heart on any man, leſs constant then he had ſhewed himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this, the Princeſs <hi>Porcias</hi> Relations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquainted with her deſign, came to them, who being of the moſt Conſiderable Perſons of the Kingdom, ſoon got a Licence, or diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rather, from the Arch-Biſhop for their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; which was Conſumated that very night, by the Curate of the Pariſh, a good Prieſt, and an excellent Preacher; ſo that you may believe they wanted not a fitting Exhortation. It was reported, that they roſe not up the next day till it was very late, which I am apt enough to believe. The News was ſoon ſpread abroad, whereat the <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> who was nearly Related to <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> was ſo glad, that the Publick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements began afreſh in <hi>Naples,</hi> where they ſtill tell wonders of the brave <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> and his <hi>Inviſible Mistris.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>RAgotins</hi> Hiſtory had the general applauſe of the Company; which puff'd him up ſo, as if it had been of his own invention; this with his Natural Pride made him begin to treat the Players Arrogantly, when going to the Women he took them perforce by the hands, and would needs be ſidling a little; as it is the Countrey guiſe of Courtſhip, which ſavours more of the Satyr then Civility. Madam <hi>Star</hi> did only pluck her ſnowy hands, out of his ſweaty ſhaggy fiſts; but her Aſſociate, Madam <hi>Angelica</hi> gave him a ſound rap on the knuckles with her busk. This made him retire in a Fume, bluſhing and mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering between his teeth to the reſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, where every ones tongue run at random, the one not minding what another ſaid. <hi>Rago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> put moſt of them to ſilence with his loud bawling out, to know how they approved of his Nowel? A Young Fellow, whoſe name is out of my thoughts at preſent, briskly replyes, <hi>That it was no more his then anothers, ſince he had taken it out of a Book,</hi> and as he ſaid this, pulled one that ſtuck half way out of <hi>Ragotin</hi>'s greaſie pocket, who ſcatched him fiercely by the hands to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it again; but in diſpite of <hi>Ragotin,</hi> he gave it
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60933:34"/>to the next man whom <hi>Ragotin</hi> ſtreight ſeized upon, but as unſuccesfully as the firſt, the Book being conveyed already to a third, and ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on thorow four or five ſeveral hands, which <hi>Ragotin</hi> could not reach to, being the ſhorteſt man of the company. At length, having raiſed himſelf a tip-toe five or ſix times, torn as many cuffs, and clawed as many wriſts in vain, whil'ſt the Book ſtill moved above his reach in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle region of the Chamber, poor <hi>Ragotin</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving every one laughed at this frolick, flew like a Tyger upon the firſt Authour of the Plot, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him ſeveral thumps on the gutts with his dire fiſt, which was the height of his Ability. Whil'ſt the other crowing over him with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, ſtroke him directly on the crown of his hat, which being extravagantly high, broad at the top, and ſtrait at the band, drove his head into it up to the very chin, with the weight of his blowes, which lighted ſo heavily on his noddle, that it ſhooke his weak brain out of all order, and amazed him ſo, he knew not where he was; and to compleat his Victory, this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs Adverſary throwing his legg up between the little Fellows neck and ſhoulders, tumbled him down on his punnion end, at the Womens feet, after a moſt precipitate retrogradation. Imagine I beſeech you, in what a huff and rage that little Fellow muſt have been in, who had more pride then all the finical Barbers in the Nation, and eſpecially at that time, when he was cryed up for his Hiſtory, and in preſence of thoſe fair Actreſſes, whom he intended to make
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60933:34"/>Love to, but to which of them in particular he deſign'd his Addreſſes, he was not yet reſolved on himſelf, as you will find anon.

Yet could he not forbear rayling at the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60933:35"/>perſon that had uſed him ſo roughly; but being more vain then vindicative, he changed his rude diſcourſe for milder language, and told the Players, as if he had promiſed them a great rarity, <hi>That he intended to make a Comedy of his forementioned History, which he reſolved to handle ſo Poetically, as ſhould make this firſt Eſſay a Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, whereas others are forced to make divers tryals, and cannot arrive to any perfection without much toyle and labour, riſing gradually step by step:</hi> Deſtiny <hi>replyed,</hi> That his Story was indeed very pleaſant, and Comical, yet in his humble opinion, not fit for the Theatre: <hi>I ſhall not deſire you to inſtruct me,</hi> ſayes Ragotin. <hi>my Mother was the Famous Poet</hi> Garniers <hi>Grand-Daughter, and I, as ſimple as you take me to be, who thus vouch ſafe to anſwer you, I my own ſelf, have that Learned Mans Ink-horn in my own poſſeſſion to this hour.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60933:36"/>one another; ſurely this cannot but take exceeding well, and would deſerve to be clapp'd; I confeſs I am of your opinion in one thing, that we must not Act things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decant, either reflecting on Religion, or contrary to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Virtues; and therefore to avoid both thoſe Rocks, I would not have them to meet or ſpeak of their Amours within the Church it ſelf, but aſſign them a place before the Church door. Destiny</hi> interrupted him, to know where he would find ſo many Men and Women Actors as he intended for that Scene? <hi>Pray how do they do in the Colledges? where they give Baettle ſometimes, replies</hi> Rogatin. <hi>I myſelf at</hi> La Fleſche <hi>Acted once a part in the Defeat of the</hi> Pont deſe, <hi>a Play ſo called, where,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>there appeared above a hundred Souldiers of the Queen Mothers party in one body upon the Stage, beſides thoſe of the Kings Army more numerous then the others; And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that by reaſon of a great ſtorm of Rain, which fell that day; and partly ſpoyled our ſport, the Plumes of all the Nobility we had borrowed, being ſoak'd in the ſhowre,</hi> it was ſaid, <hi>thoſe Feathers would hardly ever riſe up in faſhion in our daies again. Destiny,</hi> who delighted to hear him diſcourſe ſo judiciouſly, <hi>Replied,</hi> That Colledges indeed were ſtored with Schollers enough for ſuch a deſign, but their whole company conſiſted but of ſeven or eight when they were fulleſt; <hi>Rancour,</hi> who as I have elſewhere told you, was an Arch-rogue, ſided with <hi>Ragotin</hi> to make ſport, and told his fellow Player, that he could not be of his opinion; <hi>I was an Actor before you wore breeches,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and therefore ſurely better able to judge then ſuch a young
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60933:36"/>Maggot,</hi> and I ſay, <hi>that a Church Porch would make the bravest Scene in the World, and for the throng of Men and Women, they might hire part of them cheap enough, and make the reſt of Paſt-board.</hi> This pretty device of <hi>Rancours</hi> Paſt-board-men, made all the company ſmile; <hi>Ragotin</hi> ſmil'd with the reſt, <hi>and ſwore he had contrived it ſo in his thoughts before; but was loath to mention it, till time ſerved; and then the Coach too,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>what a pretty novelty that would appear upon a Stage. I once Acted</hi> Toby's Dog, <hi>and did it ſo naturally, that all the Audience was raviſhed at it; and for my own part, continued he, as we muſt judge of things by the effects and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions they make upon our ſpirits, ſo I acknowledge that I never ſaw the Play of</hi> Pyramus <hi>and</hi> This by, <hi>but I was more delighted at the ſight of the Lion, then grieved for the Death of the Lovers.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60933:39"/>any thing at his hands, who was likely to do him ſo much good; At laſt, with ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much, they began to grow full; <hi>Rancour</hi> was only a little more ſerious then before, but <hi>Ragotin</hi> grew ſo doz'd, and heavy, that he leaned his head on the Table, and fell faſt aſleep. <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour</hi> called for one to come and make ready a bed, it being too late to return to his own Inn. The Maid told him, <hi>She thought it would not be a miſs to make ready two, ſeeing what a pickle</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Ragotin <hi>was in.</hi> In the mean time, he ſlept on, and never did any man ſnore louder then himſelf. Two Beds were dreſſed in the ſame Chamber, where there was a third unuſed, but all the noiſe they made in putting on the ſheets, and ordering the Chamber could not diſturb our Little Man. He called the Wench a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Whores and Jades, and threatned to ſlay her, when ſhe called him to go to his reſt. In the concluſion, <hi>Rancour</hi> turned his Chair about to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the fire, and then he open'd his eyes, and ſuffered the Maid to uncloath him; after which they threw him by main ſtrength between his ſheets, and <hi>Rancour</hi> being gotten into Bed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, puts out the candle, after he had bolted the Chamber door. An hour afterwards <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotin</hi> riſes up, and goes out of his Bed, for what I cannot readily tell. He wanders about the room, till he had over-turned moſt of the chairs and ſtooles, and himſelf likewiſe, groaping in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very corner for his Bed, which he could not find again for his heart; In the end he lights upon <hi>Rancours,</hi> and wakes him with haling off the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60933:40"/>cloathes; <hi>Rancour</hi> asked, What he would have? <hi>I am hunting to find my bed,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ragotin;</hi> You muſt go towards my left hand, <hi>ſayes Rancour;</hi> the Little Drunkard creeps to the right, and went and neſtled himſelf betwixt the Rugg and the Matt of the third Bed, which had neither Bolſter, nor Sheets; yet there he takes out his full nap with a great deal of eaſe and quiet. <hi>Rancour</hi> in the morning put on his Apparel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ragotins</hi> eyes were open; He rouz'd the Drunken Dandy-Prat, and asked him, whether it were to do pennance, that he forſook a good Feather-bed, to lye in louſie ſtraw: <hi>Ragotin</hi> maintained he did not remove at all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for certain, that Chamber was haunted with Spirits. He quarrell'd with the Land-Lord, who ſtood up for his own concern, and threatned to Sue him, for ſlandering his houſe: But I have been too tedious in relating <hi>Ragotins</hi> debauch; let us return therefore to the place where I left our Players.</p>

               <p>I Am a perſon of too much honour and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, not to Advertiſe my Courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that, if he be offended with the Fooleries he hath hitherto met with in this preſent Volume, he would do very well to proceed no further;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60933:40"/>for on my credit, he ſhall find no other, though my book ſhould ſwell to the bulk of a Grand <hi>Cyrus;</hi> and if by the pattern he hath ſeen alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he cannot give a gueſs at the remainder of the piece, why, he is in no worſe condition then my ſelf, for by my faith, one Chapter begets another, I do like the careleſs Traveller, lay the raynes in my <hi>Pegaſus</hi> neck, and let him take his own courſe; Or perhaps I may have a ſtudied deſign, without ſtuffing my Romance with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite diſcriptions, both to divert and teach at the ſame inſtant, juſt as the ſight of a Drunkard, whoſe Vice gives us caution, and averſion, while his Apiſhneſs makes us tickle with laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to ſee the ſtrange effects of Wine. But to conclude this Morality, and return to our Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers once more. As ſoon as their Chamber was cleared from the croud, and <hi>Ragotin</hi> gone with <hi>Rancour</hi> his new gueſt; the Carrier whom they left behind them at <hi>Tours,</hi> came to the Inn with a Horſe load of their goods, and ſate down at Table amongſt them: By whoſe relation, as alſo by what they gathered from one another, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared how the Intendant of the Country was put by the deſign he contrived againſt them, having had much adoe himſelf to get out of the peoples hands, and his Guard likewiſe. <hi>Deſtiny</hi> related to them, how he made his eſcape in his Turkiſh habit, wherein he intended to act the <hi>Soliman</hi> written by <hi>Mairet,</hi> and how he came to <hi>Manſe</hi> with <hi>Cave</hi> and <hi>Rancour,</hi> avoiding <hi>Alenſon</hi> becauſe the Plague was there, they being all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired according to the deſcription mentioned at
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60933:41"/>the beginning of theſe moſt true, but leaſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick adventures. Madam <hi>Star</hi> gave them alſo an account of the aſſiſtance ſhe received from the Lady at <hi>Tours,</hi> whoſe name never came to my knowledge, and how by her means ſhe was conducted to a Village not far from <hi>Bouneſtable,</hi> where ſhe ſprained, or diſtocated her foot with a fall from her horſe. She added moreover, that being informed the reſt of the company was at <hi>Manſe,</hi> ſhe procured a Horſe-Litter to carry her thither, for which Litter ſhe was beholding to the aforeſaid charitable Lady. After Supper, <hi>Deſtiny</hi> remained alone with the Ladies in their Chamber. <hi>Cave</hi> loved him as much as if he had been her own Son; Madam <hi>Star</hi> was her darling too, and <hi>Angellica</hi> her only Daughter and Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs lov'd <hi>Deſtiny</hi> and <hi>Star,</hi> as Brother and Siſter. She did not yet certainly know what they were, nor why they became Players: But thus much ſhe plainly diſcovered, though they ſtiled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Brother and Siſter, that their kindneſs was greater then their kindred, for <hi>Deſtiny</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf with the higheſt reſpect imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble towards her; and ſhe was indued with a great deal of Wit and Diſcretion, and as <hi>Deſtiny</hi> made it appear by all his actions, that he was a perſon of no ordinary Education, ſo Madam <hi>Star</hi> had rather the demeanour of a Lady of Quality, then a wandring Comedian. Now as <hi>Deſtiny</hi> and <hi>Star</hi> were cheriſhed by Miſtris <hi>Cave</hi> and her Daughter, ſo did they pay them a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal friendſhip in return, which we need not much to wonder at, ſince they deſerved as
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60933:41"/>much as any Players in <hi>France,</hi> though thorow want of happineſs, rather then any want of merit, they never had the honour to appear on the Theaters of <hi>L' Hoſtel de Bourgogne,</hi> or <hi>du Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,</hi> which are the <hi>Non plus ultra</hi> of all Actors. Thoſe that cannot underſtand theſe three ſhort Latin words (which I could not forbear to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert in this place, being ſo pat to the preſent purpoſe) may get ſome body to expound them if they pleaſe. But to leave this digreſſion, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny</hi> and <hi>Star</hi> could not forbear to expreſs their great joy and careſſes, after ſo long abſence, in preſence of the two Actreſſes themſelves. They owned the infinite care and troubles they had endured for each other, and <hi>Deſtiny</hi> told Madam <hi>Star,</hi> that he verily believed, the laſt time they Acted at <hi>Tours</hi> he ſaw their old perſecutor; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpied him in the croud that were at that Play, though he endeavoured to muffle himſelf in his Cloak; ſo that finding himſelf unable to make any conſiderable reſiſtance if he had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be ſet upon at his going from the Town, he had clapt a great black patch upon his cheek. Then he proceeded to relate the adventure of the many Horſe-Litters that met together on the way, <hi>and ſaid,</hi> He was much miſtaken if the unknown perſon that ſearched all the Litters ſo narrowly, as may be ſeen in the Seventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were not the ſame forementioned enemy of theirs. Whilſt <hi>Deſtiny</hi> talked of theſe things, poor <hi>Star</hi> could not refrain from ſhedding ſome tears; <hi>Deſtiny</hi> was much moved thereat, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given her the beſt comfort he could, <hi>he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:60933:42"/>That in caſe ſhe would but permit him to take as much care in ſeeking out their common Enemy, as ſhe had made him uſe, to ſhun him hitherto, he duſt engage that ſhe ſhould either quickly be freed from thoſe perſecutions, or he would looſe his life in the Attempt. Theſe laſt words afflicted her yet more and more; and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny</hi> could not but ſhare therein, <hi>Cave</hi> and her Daughter, who were naturally inclined to pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, kept conſort with them out of civility, or by contagion, ſo that I believe they ſhed ſome ſalt water too. I cannot affirm that <hi>Deſtiny</hi> wept, but this I dare aſſure you, that both he and the Women ſtood all mute for a good ſpace, whilſt thoſe that were moſt tender-hearted expreſſed it with the ſilent oratory of their trickling tears, the others with loud ſighes. At laſt, <hi>Cave</hi> put them out of this dumps, and reproached <hi>Deſtiny</hi> and <hi>Star,</hi> for having converſed ſo long and friendly with her, and her Daughter; and yet put ſo little confidence in either of them, as to conceal their real condition from them all that while. <hi>To which ſhe further added,</hi> That ſhe had undergone ſo much affliction in her own perſon, that they could hardly ever meet with any one more capable to give counſel to ſuch as were in perplexity, as they appeared to be, then ſhe her ſelf was. <hi>To which</hi> Deſtiny <hi>replyed,</hi> That it was no diſtruſt that had made them keep it a ſecret ſo long; but only he fancied the relation of ſo many misfortunes would have proved too Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly a ſtory for her ear. He afterwards proffered to give her an account when ſhe had
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60933:42"/>ſo much time to throw away, or had a mind to hear it. <hi>Cave</hi> would not have it deferr'd at all, and her Daughter, who earneſtly deſired the ſame thing, being ſat on the Bed-ſide near her, and <hi>Star. Deſtiny</hi> was about to begin his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when on a ſudden they heard a great up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar in the next Chamber. <hi>Deſtiny</hi> liſtned to it a while, but the noiſe being rather increaſed then abated, and ſome body crying out mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>help, help, Deſtiny</hi> flung out of the Chamber in three leaps, to the ruine of his doublet, which <hi>Cave</hi> and her Daughter tore off from his back, thinking to with-hold him. He went into the other room whence the noiſe proceeded, where though all was in darkneſs, yet the many ſmart cuffs on the eares, kicks on the breech; confuſed gabbling of Mens and Womens tongues who were deſperately engaged in fight, together with the trampling of their bare feet on the floor, made a moſt horrid noiſe. He thruſts himſelf imprudently amongſt the ſcuffle, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately received a box on either cheek. This made him change his mind of parting thoſe gobblins, into an eager deſire of revenge; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to make uſe of his fiſts, and whirling his body round, with his armes ſpread like a turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyle, they met with many an inviſible enemy, though not immortal, as afterwards appeared by his bloody hands. The battle laſted yet long enough to afford him a ſcore of good luſty thumps in return of his civility, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid them again with double the number for intereſt. In the heat of the Combat, he felt one
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60933:43"/>bite him by the calf of his leg, he puts down his hand, and feeling ſomething that was hairy, thought it ſome dog that had faſtned on him; but <hi>Cave</hi> and her Daughter, who appeared at the Chamber door, with a light, like <hi>St. Elmes</hi> fire after a ſtorm, made <hi>Deſtiny</hi> ſoon find he was in the midſt of ſeven people in their ſhirts and ſmocks only, who let go their hold, and ungrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled themſelves from one another, as ſoon as ever the light was brought. But the calm was ſoon ruffled again; mine Hoſt who was one of the ſeven white Penitents, layes hold again on the Poet; <hi>Olive</hi> was likewiſe aſſaulted by mine Hoſts Tapſter, another white Fryar. <hi>Destiny</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to part the fray, but the Hoſteſs who was the beaſt that bit him by the leg, which he took for a dog, or bitch, by her bare head, and ſhort locks, flew at his face with the help of her two Maids, as naked and bare-headed as her ſelf. The yelping huntſ-up began afreſh, the blowes went merrily round, and the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment grew fiercer and hotter then at firſt. At laſt, other people alarum'd with the noiſe, came upon the ſpot, made their way thorow the thickeſt of the croud, parted them, and made them ſuſpend the ſecond time. The queſtion was now, to know the cauſe of the quarrel, and what could be the accident that had drawn ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven naked people into one Chamber without light. <hi>Olive</hi> who ſeemed to be leſt moved, <hi>ſaid,</hi> That the Poet being gone forth of his Chamber, return'd again with more then uſual ſpeed, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſn'd by the Maſter of the Houſe, who threatn'd to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60933:43"/>beat him; the Hoſteſs follow'd her Husband, and ſets upon the Poet, when himſelf going to part them, was engaged by the Man and the two Maid-Servants, and the candle falling down, made them fight longer for want of it, then he believed they would otherwiſe have done. Now the Poet was to plead for himſelf, <hi>who told them,</hi> That he had made a couple of the rareſt Stanza's that ever were compoſed, but having them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his memory, and fearing leſt ſuch rarities ſhould be loſt for want of writing them down, he went for a Candle to ſee to inſert them in his Book, but the Maids only laughed at him, and becauſe he reproved them, mine Hoſt called him Rope-dancer, which he anſwered with the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet of Cuckold. he had no ſooner ſpoken the word, but mine Hoſt, who was ſtill within the reach of him, gave him a ſound box, one would have ſworn this was the ſignal for battle, for the cuff on the ear was no ſooner given, but with one conſent, the Wife, the Man, and the Maid-Servants ran up to the Players, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them again moſt furiouſly, who received the on-ſet bravely. This laſt rencontre was more deſparate, and laſted longer, then both the others. <hi>Destiny</hi> having grappled and board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a fat Wench, turned up her tayle, and clapt her luſtily on the breech with the ſole of his ſlipper. <hi>Olive</hi> perceiving this made the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany laugh, did as much to the other Laſs. Mine Hoſt was at work with the Poet, and the Land-Lady, who was indeed the greateſt fury of all, being ceazed on by ſome of the Spectators, grew
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60933:44"/>ſo mad at it, that like a Bedlam, ſhe bauled out thieves, thieves. Her cries awaked <hi>La Rappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niere</hi> who lodged juſt over the way. He made them open the door, and imagining by the hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub, there could be no leſs then ſeven or eight at leaſt ſlain, he commanded them to keep the Peace in the Kings Name, and being informed of the occaſion of this diſorder, he exhorted the Poet to make no more Stanza's in the night, and was like to have cudgelled the Hoſt and his Wife for rayling at the Players, calling them nick-names, and ſwearing he would unkennel them the next day; but <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> to whom this Hoſt was ſomewhat indebted, threatned to Arreſt him, and that muzled him. <hi>La Rappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niere</hi> return'd home again, the reſt went to their ſeveral lodgings, and <hi>Destiny</hi> to the Actreſſes Chamber, where <hi>Cave</hi> conjured him not to put off his promiſe any longer of relating both his own and his Siſters Adventures. He told them, he deſired no better, and began his ſtory, in the ſame manner as you ſhall finde in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

But as for S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Far,</hi> he nicknamed us <hi>The dull Book-wormes,</hi> and went each day abroad a hunting or beating the counrey people, at which he was very active. The inclination I had to ſtudy and temperance, got me the good will of the Baron of <hi>Arques,</hi> who was as tender of me as if I had been his kinſman. He would not part me from his Sons, when he ſent them to the <hi>Accademy,</hi> about which time, an eminent Noble man, and one that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Baron <hi>D' Arques</hi> raiſing ſome troops of horſe for the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſervice.

The good Gentleman would needs have me venture likewiſe, and <hi>Monſieur de Saint Sauveur</hi> my God father, who lov'd me extreamly, freely gave me a very conſiderable bill of Exchange that I might not be too chargeable to thoſe whom I had the honour to accompany, and to make uſe of upon occaſion. We took the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt way about that we might have the ſight of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſome other of the chiefeſt Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> in each of which we made ſome ſtay, thoſe onely excepted whereof the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60933:49"/>In <hi>Rome</hi> I fell ſick, and the two brothers proſecuted their journey; he that carried them not daring to looſe the opportunity of the Popes Gallies, which were going to joyne with the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Armada</hi> about the <hi>Dardenellas,</hi> where they lay in wait for the <hi>Turks. Vervill</hi> was the moſt ſorrowful man that could be, to leave me, and I almoſt diſpaired to think of his going at that time from me, when I hoped to have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred my ſelf worthy of his affection, by ſome ſignal ſervice. As for Saint <hi>Far,</hi> I think he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as if he had never ſeen me, nor did I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect him, but as the brother of <hi>Vervill,</hi> who left me all the money he could amaſs together, but whether with his brothers conſent or not, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. Thus was I left ſick at <hi>Rome,</hi> without any other acquaintance then my Landlord, who was a <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Apothecary; I had all the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and aſſiſtance that could be deſired, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my Malady; he had no little skill in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and (according to my poor judgment) I found him farr more able then the <hi>Italian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, that undertook me.

One day when I was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one of the faireſt gardens, I ſaw about the turning of the walk, a couple of women in very good habits, whom two young <hi>French</hi> men had ſtop'd, and would not ſuffer to paſſe by them, till the youngeſt had taken off the vail which cover'd her face. The one of theſe, who ſeemed to be the Maſter, was indeed ſo inſolent as to offer to pull off her vail by force, whileſt ſhe that was bare-faced was with-held by his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. I made no demur upon what I thought my ſelf obliged to do; but told thoſe uncivil perſons, their inſolence was not to be endured.

After which words, to retribute as it were the ſervice
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60933:50"/>I had done them, ſhe added, that although ſhe had refuſed her daughter ſhould unvail her face upon compulſion, it was but juſt however, that ſhe ſhould uncover her ſelf to me.

She had no ſooner ſaid ſo, but her daughter in obedience took off her vail, or rather dazled me. I never beheld any thing ſo beautifull; ſhe caſt her bright eyes twice or thrice upon me, as it were by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her mother was very fond of her; for ſhe ſee med to participate of the delight I took in beholding her daughter. But I being unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the like Adventures, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what out of countenance thorow my youthfull baſh fulneſs betraid a timerous kind of weakneſs by the cold compliments I made in anſwer to their repeated thanks; when they took their leaves of me, which perhaps gave them a worſe opinion of my judgment, then they had of my courage. I was vexed in my minde, I had not inquired where they dwelt, and proffer'd to wait upon them to their lodging; but when it was too late to overtake them, I asked the Gardiner whether he knew them; and it was a long time before we could underſtand each other, he ſpeaking as broken <hi>French,</hi> as my <hi>Italian.</hi> As laſt more by figns then words, he made me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, they were unknown to him. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60933:51"/>back again to my <hi>Dutch Apothecary,</hi> not the ſame man as I went forth, that is to ſay, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much ſmitten, and very deſirous to know, whether the fair <hi>Leonora</hi> were a <hi>Courtezan,</hi> or an honeſt Lady, and whether ſhe had as much wit as her mother ſhewed in her diſcourſe. This made me reſign my ſelf up to Melancholly and ſullen penſiveneſs; flattering my ſelf with a thouſand imaginary hopes, which ſomewhat diverted me at firſt, but after wards left me in grief and trouble, when I had duly weighed the improbability of the thing Having built many Caſtles in the air, at laſt, I took up a reſolution of ſeeking them out again, preſuming I could, not hunt very long without retriving them, in ſome part or other of that City, which is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Populus. This made me walk abroad the ſecond time on the ſame day, ſearching in every place where I could expect to finde them, but I return'd back much more tyred and diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then I was before. The next day I began a ſtricter ſearch, but with the ſame ſucceſs, which encreaſed my diſcontent. The ſpeed I made in hurrying up and down, the often caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up my eyes at every window I paſſed, and the clutter I betraid in following every woman, that had the leaſt reſemblance of my <hi>Leonora</hi>'s ſhape or ſtature, made me be taken by every one that obſerved it, for the moſt ridiculous <hi>Monſieur</hi> that ever appeared in <hi>Rome,</hi> to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the whole Nation. 'Tis very ſtrange, how I could recover any ſtrength, being in this damnable pickle, ſo over head and ears in love,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60933:51"/>with I knew not whom. And yet my bodily health encreaſed till I was perfectly well, whilſt I remained ſtill diſtempered in minde, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided betwixt Love and honour the firſt detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me in <hi>Rome,</hi> the other ſummoning me to <hi>Candia,</hi> ſo that I knew not whether to obey, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the letters I often received from <hi>Verville,</hi> who conjured me by all the tyes of friendſhip to go and finde him out, or my fooliſh paſſion that had thus poſſeſt me. At laſt conſidering I could not get the leaſt intelligence of the two Ladies, though I had uſed all the poſſible diligence, I ſatisfied my Landlord, and made up my bun, dle ready to depart. The day before I went Signor <hi>Stephano Vanbergue,</hi> (ſo was my <hi>Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> called) told me, he would beſtow a dinner upon me at a friends houſe of his, and let me ſee that for a <hi>Dutch man</hi> he had made no ill choice, adding withall, that he had forborn to invite me ſooner, being a little jealous and wary in a thing concern'd his Amours. I promiſed to go rather out of complaiſance, then any other motive, and thither we went together juſt at dinner time. The houſe he led me to, had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the looks nor furniture ſutable to an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary</hi>'s Miſtris: We came firſt into a Hall, very well adorned, and from thence into a moſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent chamber where I was received by <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora</hi> and her mother. You may well imagine how much this ſurpriſal pleaſed me. This fair Virgins mother came up towards me according to the <hi>French</hi> mode of ſalutation, and truly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kiſſed my cheek then I hers; I was ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60933:52"/>that I ſcarce knew what I did, or heard what ſhe ſaid; At length I recovered my ſences; found <hi>Leonora</hi> more beautifull and charming then when I firſt beheld her; yet had not the confidence to kiſs her. I perceived my errour as ſoon as I had committed it, but not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, or daring to repair it, it called as much blood into my face, as <hi>Leonars</hi> pretty modeſt baſh fullneſs had into hers. Her mother told me, ſhe was deſirous, Before I left that City, to give me thanks for the pains I had taken in ſeeking for them; which encreaſed my confuſion. She led me to a Ruell, trickt up after the <hi>French</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, whither her daughter did not follow, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me without doubt too ſottiſh in my carriage and ſo not worthy her converſation. She ſtaid with Signor <hi>Stephano,</hi> whilſt I behaved my ſelf with her mother, juſt according to my birth, which was to ſay truth, juſt like a country clown. She was pleaſed to furniſh all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe her ſelf, and ſhewed a great deal of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and wit, though there is nothing more difficult then to make wit appear to thoſe that are void of it. For my part I never had leſs then at that nick of time, and if ſhe were not tyred with my company then, ſurely ſhe was never ſo with any one in her days. She told me amongſt many other things (to which I hardly anſwered I, or no) that ſhe was a <hi>French</hi> woman by birth, and I might know of Signor <hi>Stephano</hi> the reaſons which detained her at <hi>Rome.</hi> After this, to dinner I muſt go, and behaved my ſelf at Table as I had done before in the Ruell; for I was ſo
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60933:52"/>ſtrangly troubled, that I could ſcarce know my right hand from my left. I ſat all the time they were eating, juſt like an Image, with my eyes conſtantly fixed upon <hi>Leonoras,</hi> who was impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned with it no doubt, and to puniſh my folly, caſt her eyes another way all the while I ſtared at hers. If the mother had not diſcourſed all the dinner time, there muſt have been a midnights ſilence: but ſhe entertained Signor <hi>Stephano,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the affairs of <hi>Rome,</hi> at leaſt I imagine ſo, for I am not certain of it.

It is no policy to praiſe her we love, before thoſe that may poſſibly become as much in love with the ſame perſon themſelves, ſince affection often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſteals into the Soul as well thorow the Ear, as by the Eye, it being an overſight they too often repent of afterwards, that commit it; which I ſhall prove by my own ſad experience.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60933:56"/>Saint <hi>Far</hi> every day asked, when I would go with him to Madam <hi>De la Boiſſiere;</hi> and one day importuning me very earneſtly, I told him, I knew not whether ſhe would admit him by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhe lived very retired. I perceive you love her daughter, ſaid he, and then telling me he could find the way alone, began to urge me ſo much, that I was ſurprized, and appeared ſo concerned, that he diſcovered cleerly, what before he onely barely conjectured, which made him railly me ſo ſeverely, as made <hi>Verville</hi> pitty the condition I was in. He took me away from his uncivil brother, and made me walk with him to the <hi>Cours,</hi> where I was extreamly perplexed, notwithſtanding all the pains <hi>Vervil</hi> took to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert me. Mean time, his ill-natured brother, was indeavouring his own ſatisfaction, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my ruine. He goes directly to Madam <hi>De la Boiſſieres,</hi> where they gave him entrance inſtead of me, being Trappan'd by my Landlords ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingman whom he had choſen for his guide, as being well acquainted at the houſe; without which invention he would ſcarce have had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance. Madam <hi>De La Boiſſiere</hi> was much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to meet a ſtranger there. She told Saint <hi>Far,</hi> that being unacquainted with him, she knew not to what she might attribute the honour of his viſit.

At laſt this gallant Gentleman, grew weary of importuning them, freed them from his troubleſome Courtſhip, and returned to Signor <hi>Stephanos,</hi> having reaped but very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle advantage to himſelf by the unworthy trick he put upon me. Ever after, as it is the nature of thoſe brutiſh people, to continue miſchievous againſt thoſe they have wronged, he became ſo inſolent, and diſobliged me ſo frequently, that I would a hundred times have waved all reſpect towards him, had not his brother <hi>Vervills</hi> good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made me contain my anger, and endure his follys. I did not as yet know the ſlurr he had put upon me particularly, though I ſeveral times found the effects of it. I perceived Madam <hi>De La Boiſſieres</hi> coldneſs indeed, had made her leſs reſpectful then at my firſt acquaintance; but yet there was ſo much civility ſtill in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, I did not think ſhe was grown weary of me.

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60933:57"/>thoughts her countenance was more invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and her looks expreſſed ſomwhat of kindneſs. <hi>Deſtiny</hi> was thus relating his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the <hi>Comedians</hi> gave attentive ear to him, not ſeeming to have the leaſt inclination to ſleep, when the clock ſtriking two, Madam <hi>Cave</hi> put <hi>Deſtiny</hi> in mind he was to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the ſame <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> that day to a houſe about two leagues out of Town, where they were to hunt.

This <hi>Curate</hi> then took up his lodgin at the ſame Inn with our Players, and having conſulted with a Phyſitian about the Stone and Gravel, who told him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Elegantly in <hi>Latin,</hi> that he was ſubject to that diſeaſe which he diſcovered to him before, and alſo having made an end of ſome other affairs of his own concern, which came not to my knowledg: This good Paſtour, I ſay, went from the Inn, about nine in the Morning, to his own Flock or Sheep-Fold, and a young Neece of his, habited like a Gentlewoman, whether ſhe were ſo or not, ſat in the fore-part of the Litter at the good mans feet, who was very Short and Fat. A Country Fellow, by name <hi>William,</hi> guided the fore-horſe by expreſs order of the <hi>Curate,</hi> for fear the Horſe ſhould faulter, whilſt the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi> ſerving-man, hight <hi>Julian,</hi> took great care and pains with the hinder horſe, who was ſo reſty, that truſty <hi>Julian</hi> was often forced to thruſt him forwards with his ſhoulders by main ſtrength. The <hi>Curates</hi> Chamber-pot being of Copper and Gliſtering like Gold, as having been newly ſcowred at the Inn, was faſtned to the right ſide of the Litter, which made it look much more trim then the left ſide, that was only ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a paſt-board hat-caſe, which the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> had taken up of the <hi>Paris</hi> Meſſenger for a Gentleman and friend of his, who boarded with him at <hi>Dom-Front.</hi> About a League and half from the Town, as the Litter was jogging on, in the midſt of a deep Road fenced on either
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60933:58"/>hand with a very thick hedge; three Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſeconded by two Foot-men, made the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Litter ſtand. The one of theſe, who ſeemed to be Captain of theſe <hi>Padders,</hi> ſaid with a ſurly voice; <hi>S' death, the first that mumbles one word Ile pistol him,</hi> and preſented the muzle of one within two inches of poor <hi>Williams</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head who led the Horſe-Litter; a ſecond did the like to <hi>Julian,</hi> when one of the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men levell'd at the Neene, who all this while ſlept very ſoundly in the Litter, never dreaming of the danger, and by conſequence not frighted like the reſt of the pacifick train. Theſe Villanous fellows drove along the Litter, with more haſt then the dull Jades were willing to make, and never was there a greater ſilence kept, where ſo much violence was offer'd. The <hi>Curates</hi> Neece was rather dead then living, <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> wept, but durſt not ſpeak a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, and the <hi>Curate</hi> as I ſhould have told you, ſlept as ſoundly as his Neece. One of the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men leaves the groſs of the party, and gallops away before. In the interim, the Horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Litter was driven into a Wood, and no ſooner in, but the fore-horſe, perhaps as much frighted as he that guided him, or elſe out of pure ſpight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they forced him to go faſter then his dull nature had a mind too; this poor Horſe I ſay, ſets his foot in a hole, and ſtumbles ſo rudely, that Maſter <hi>Curate</hi> was awakened, and his Neece thrown out of the Litter, upon the lean Jades ſcraggy crupper. The good man calls to <hi>Julian,</hi> who durſt not reply for his life; then he calls
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60933:58"/>upon his Neece, who had ſomewhat elſe to do, then liſten to him, <hi>William</hi> was as hard-hearted as the reſt; ſo that the <hi>Curate</hi> was angry to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Some hold that he ſwore by his Maker; but I ſhall not ſo eaſily believe that of ſuch a <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</hi> The <hi>Curates</hi> Neece having raiſed her ſelf up again from the hackneys crupper, ſate down in her place again, but durſt not caſt a look on her Uncle, and the Horſe having gotten upon his feet alſo, trotted away much ſwifter then before, notwithſtanding, the <hi>Curate</hi> ſcreamed out all the while with his effeminate voice, <hi>stop, stop.</hi> His loud bawling, ſcared the Horſes, and made them run as if the Devil drove, and their running made him gape and ſqueak the lowder. Sometimes he called: <hi>Julian,</hi> another time <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> and many times his Neece; to whoſe name he often added the Epither of double Whore and Carrion. She might have replyed indeed, if ſhe now would, for he that had impoſed that ſtoickt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſilence, had left the Litter to over take and joyn with thoſe that rode before, about fifty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>aces from thence; But the ſear of the <hi>Carabine</hi> ſtill kept her inſenſibly careleſs of her Uncles exclamations, and opprobrious Epither<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, which made him at laſt howl and cry out, help, and murther, finding them ſo obſtinately rebellion. Thereupon the two Caveliers that rode in the head of the party; having notice given them by the Foot men, returned back, to the Horſe-Litter, and made it ſtand; and one ſpeaking with an imperious tone, asked <hi>Williams,</hi> What fool is that that bawls ſo in the Litter? Alas!
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60933:59"/>Sir, you know better then I, replyed poor <hi>Will.</hi> The rugged Souldier runs the butt end of his Piſtol into the peaſants teeth, and preſenting the muzle to the Neece, who was not uſed to play on ſuch pipes, commands her to unmask, and tell him, who ſhe was. The <hi>Curate</hi> now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving all that paſſed out of his Litter, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Sute in Law with a Gentleman Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of his, name <hi>De Laune,</hi> apprehended it muſt needs be he, that was come to murther him. Wherefore he began to call out; <hi>Monſieur de Laune,</hi> I appeal to God Almighty, if you kill me, being a Sacred Prieſt, I will amongſt the innocent ſheep at his right hand, have you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated to the left, with the Goats, and Ravenous Wolves. In the mean while, his poor Neece pulls off her mask, and diſcovered an unknown and affrighted countenance to the Cavelier. This produced an unexpected event; For the cholerick Gentleman diſcharged his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol in the Horſes flank, that carried the forepart of the Litter, and ſhot one of his Foot-men in the head with another Piſtol that hung at his Sadle, <hi>Saying,</hi> this you deſerve for your falſe Intelligence. Then was the fears of the <hi>Curate</hi> and his ſmall Retinue increaſed. He called for confeſſion; <hi>Julian</hi> and <hi>William</hi> caſt themſelves down upon their knees, and the Neece crept cloſe to her Uncle. But thoſe that had put them in this affright, left them, and haſted thence with all imaginable ſpeed, leaving none of the crew, but the dead man to keep them company. <hi>Julian</hi> and <hi>William</hi> roſe up again, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60933:59"/>told, the <hi>Curate</hi> and his Neece, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were gone. They unharneſs'd the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermoſt horſe to ſet the Litter upright, and <hi>Willy</hi> was diſpatched away to a neighbouring Village for another horſe. The <hi>Curate</hi> knew not what to think of the accident that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen him, nor could imagine wherefore they had brought him ſo far out of his way; left him again without robbing him, and killed one of their own company, which troubled him leſſe then the loſſe of his own horſe, who poor inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent creature, as he fancied, could not be guilty of any confederacy with that Villain. However he concluded ſtill, it muſt be <hi>De Laune,</hi> that meant to murther him, and therefore he reſolved, to have ſatisfaction from him. His Neece maintained that it was not <hi>De Laune,</hi> with whom ſhe was acquainted; but yet the (<hi>urate</hi> would have it ſo, to make good an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, truſting perhaps to ſome Knights of the Poſt of his Kindreds acquaintance at <hi>Goron.</hi> Whilſt they were in the heat of this conteſt, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> ſp es ſome Horſe-men coming afar off, and ran away for fear as faſt as his leggs would carry him. The <hi>Curates</hi> Neece ſeeing <hi>Julian</hi> fly, thought he had reaſon for it, and ſoon follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after; which made the <hi>Curate</hi> looſe all the little ſtock of reaſon he had left him, not being able to gueſs what Malignant Planets influence, produced ſo many extraordinary events. At laſt he ſaw the Horſe-men that had made them run, and which was worſe, ſaw them riding directly towards him. This ſmall Squadron
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60933:60"/>conſiſted of nine or ten Troopers, and in the midſt was a Fellow bound, on a ſcurvey Jade, with a hanging look. The <hi>Curate</hi> falls to his prayers, recommending his own, and his horſes ſafety to providence; but he was both aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and comforted at the ſame inſtant, finding it was <hi>La Rappiniere,</hi> and ſome of his black guard. <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> asked him, what he did there, and whether he had killed the man that lay dead by the Litter. The <hi>Curate</hi> gave him a full account of all paſſages, and concluded it was <hi>de Laune</hi> that had way-laid him, upon which <hi>la Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piniere</hi> made ample inquiry. One of Archers, or Guard, went to the next Villagers, to fetch off the dead corps, and returned again with the <hi>Curates</hi> Neece, and <hi>Julian</hi> after due informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who likewiſe met with honeſt <hi>William,</hi> bringing a freſh horſe for the Litter. The <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> returned to <hi>Domfront</hi> without any more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles, where as long as he lives, this ſtory of his Adventures, ſhall be his Entertainment for all Strangers. The dead horſe was eaten up by Crows, Wolves or Dogs; the dead man was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried I know not where, and <hi>Rappiniere, Olive, Rancour,</hi> and the Archers of the Guard, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their Priſoner to <hi>Manſe.</hi> And ſo the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Players hunting with <hi>Le Rappiniere,</hi> was ſuch, that they took a Man inſtead of a Hare.</p>

And for her Daughters part, if I may judge by what ſhe hath done ſince, then I may truly ſay ſhe pitted me, though contrary to her Mothers will, who kept ſo ſtrict a guard upon her, that we could never have the opportunity to meet in private. But to ſay truth, though this fair Virgin would have been more favourable then her Mother, ſhe durſt no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that I ſuffered moſt helliſhly, whilſt my aſſiduous endeavours made me more hatefull, where I endeavoured to grow more in favour.

                     </gap>e, which I accepted with as much joy, as ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ould have regret to be neceſſitated to make uſe
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60933:63"/>of me. I conducted her to a certain Cardinals who was then Protector of the <hi>French,</hi> who very kindly gave her Audience upon the firſt motion ſhe made. The buſineſs muſt needs have been of ſome importance, and no little difficulty; for ſhe was a long time with him in a private Grotto, or cover'd Fountain in the midſt of a fair Garden, whilſt all the Cardinals Followers walked into thoſe parts of the Garden they had moſt fancy too. Now was I gotten into a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, though large, walk of Orange Trees, alone with the Beautifull <hi>Leonora</hi> as I had often wiſhed before in vain, and yet as modeſt and faint-hearted as ever I had been. I cannot tell whether ſhe perceived it, or not, or whether I owed theſe firſt words to her own good nature, which made her addeſs her ſelf to me in this manner. My Mother, ſaid ſhe, will have ſome reaſon to chide <hi>Signor Stephano,</hi> for miſſing her to day, and giving you this trouble to wait here ſo long. And I am infinitely obliged to him, replyed I, for having unawares procured me a happineſs above my hopes and merit. I am too far upon the ſcore of obligation towards you, ſaid ſhe, too mit any thing that may prove your advantage, therefore pray let me know where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the happineſs conſiſts, you mention, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by him, that I may ſhare in the content, if it be ſuch as will not offend a Maidens modeſt car. I am afraid, replyed I, that you will think my words preſumptuous, rather then immodeſt, and ſo tye up my tongue again before I have ſaid all the great truth, I would fain diſcover.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60933:63"/>I, anſwered ſhe, No, I am not ſo envious at any mans proſperity, to call it preſumptuous, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially a perſon to whom I am indebted for my Honour and Protection. 'Tis not your envy that I fear, ſaid I, but ſomewhat worſe in my opinion. What other motive, replyed ſhe, can there be to make me oppoſe your happineſs? Your diſdam, ſaid I. I ſhall be much perplexed, anſwered ſhe, till you let me know what I ſhould diſdam, and how this diſdain may concern you. I could ſoon unfold this ridle, ſaid I, but I cannot tell whether you will be pleaſed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it. Do not let me hear it then, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe, for when we have ſuch doubts, it either ſignifies it cannot eaſily be underſtood, or, may diſpleaſe. I confeſs I have admired a hundred times ſince, how I could anſwer this, my minde being more intent upon her Mothers return, and ſurpriſing us, then on the diſcourſe we held. However at laſt, I called up all my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and without more delay, I told her, without minding her laſt words; That I had long ſought for an opportunity to ſpeak with her, thereby to confirm what I had preſumed to expreſs in my Letter, which yet I durſt not have undertaken, but on the knowledge that ſhe had ſeen that writing. To this I added a great deal of what was in that ſcribble, and ſaid moreover, that being now ready to go a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier in the War the Pope was making on ſome of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, and being reſolved to dye there, ſince I found my ſelf unworthy to live for her, I would intreat her only to do me this
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60933:64"/>laſt favour, to tell me what opinion ſhe would have had for me, had my Birth and Fortune been equall to the ambition I had to love and adore her. She told me, bluſhing, That my death would be a real hearty ſorrow to her; and therefore ſaid ſhe, if you are ſtill the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging perſon, preſerve your ſelf ſtill ſo, and let us not looſe a man that hath been ſo ſerviceable to us; or at leaſt, if you will needs dye, for ſome greater reaſon, then you have hither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, yet reprieve the ſad doom till we are returned into <hi>France</hi> again, wither my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and my ſelf are ſuddenly going. I implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her to diſcover her thoughts more fully and clearly. But her Mother was by this time come ſo nigh, that ſhe could not have ſatisfied me if ſhe had intended it. Madam <hi>de la Boiſſiere</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon me ſlightly enough, perhaps becauſe ſhe conſidered the conveniency I had had to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her Daughter in private, who likewiſe ſeemed to be ſomewhat troubled in her thoughts, which made me ſtay but a little while with them after their being returned home. I left them the moſt contented men in the World, putting the beſt interpretation and inferences on her diſcourſe. The next day I omitted not to wait upon them according to my cuſtome; I was told they were gone forth; nay the ſame anſwer was given me for three dayes together, and yet I could not refrain. In fine, Signor <hi>Stephano</hi> wiſhed me to go no more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Madam <hi>de la Boiſſiere</hi> would not ſuffer me to ſee her Daughter, and, ſaid he, I think you
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60933:64"/>have too much ſpirit to abide a perſonal refuſal. Then he told me the reaſon of this ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Leonoras</hi> Mother had caught her writing a Letter to me, and having ſeverely reproved her for it, did afterwards give a ſtrict order, that her people ſhould alwayes deny their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within, when I came to pay my viſit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to her; and then I likewiſe diſcovered the unhandſome trick Saint <hi>Far</hi> had put upon me, which was indeed the onely cauſe of all theſe little affronts were made uſe of againſt me, my company growing loathſome to her ever ſince that unhandſome character was given of me. But though the Mother were thus nice, yet <hi>Stephano</hi> aſſured me, from <hi>Leonoras</hi> own mouth, that my deſerts, made her wave my mean birth and fortune, and would have tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over her higheſt thoughts, could ſhe have gained her Mothers fair conſent, who was too haughty to be perſwaded to ſuch low ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions. I ſhall not trouble you, with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparate thoughts, this unwelcome news put me into; I was as much concerned, as if <hi>Leonora</hi> had unjuſtly refuſed me, though I had little hopes, and leſs right to claim the leaſt poſſeſſion in her heart; I railed againſt Saint <hi>Far,</hi> and had ſome thoughts of ſending a challenge to him; But in the end, conſidering how much I was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to his father and brother, I had no other refuge but my tears, to give my heart eaſe. I wept like an Infant, and became troubleſome or ridiculous in all ſociety. Then was I neer the time of my departure thence, and that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60933:65"/>was imbittered by the conſideration that I muſt go away, and not take my laſt fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to ſweeten my tedious abſence. We made one <hi>Campania</hi> in the <hi>Popes</hi> Army, where I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured all I could to end my days. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune oppoſed me in this, as ſhe had done in all my other attempts. I could not meet with death the onely thing I ſought for, but I acquired a reputation which I ſought not for, and that to ſuch a high degree, it would have made me proud at any other time; Whereas I then could value nothing but the ſorrowful remembrance of my dear <hi>Leonora.</hi> Saint <hi>Far</hi> and <hi>Verville</hi> were called into <hi>France</hi> again by their Father, who received them with all imaginable gladneſs and affection. My Mother gave me a very indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reception; and as for my Father he dwelt at <hi>Paris</hi> with Count <hi>Glaris,</hi> who had choſen him Governor to his ſon. The Baron <hi>D' Arques,</hi> who was made acquainted with my fears of Arms, in <hi>Italy,</hi> where I had ſaved <hi>Vervilles</hi> life, would needs have me abide with him in quality of a Gentleman. He gave me liberty to viſit my Father at <hi>Paris,</hi> where I found leſs welcome, then I had done from my Mother. Any other perſon, that had had a ſon of my parts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, would certainly have indeavoured to have preferred him in the Earls Family; but my Father turned me out thence with as much haſte as if it had been ſome diſcredit to him; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached my being too gallant, a thouſand times as we went along the ſtreets; told me I ſeemed proud, and that it would have been fitter for
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60933:65"/>me to have learned ſome handy-crafts trade, then thus to flaunt with a ſword. You may imagine this diſcourſe ſounded but harſh in a young mans ears, that had been well bred, and gained a more then vulgar repute by his valour; and who beſides, had dared to love a handſome Lady, and make it known unto her. I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the knowledge of that reſpect due to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor all the tyes of Nature could make me refrain from looking on him as an old teſty trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome perſon. He led me through three or four ſeveral ſtreets, with the ſame civility and endearments, and then ſhook me off ſuddenly, forbidding me from coming neer him any more. I was willing enough to obey this laſt injunction and therefore quitted him, to go and wait upon <hi>Monſieur De St. Sauveur,</hi> who received me like a Father indeed, and blamed my own Father for his unnaturalneſs, promiſing he would ſupply the care incumbent on ſuch a Parent, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver abandon me. The Baron <hi>D' Arques</hi> had ſome buſineſs of importance which obliged him to go and dwell at <hi>Paris.</hi> He took Lodgings at the very end of Saint <hi>Germains Fauxburg</hi> in a very ſtately houſe, that had been lately built with many others, which together makes it one of the pleaſanteſt places about the whole City. Saint <hi>Far</hi> and <hi>Verville,</hi> went often to the Kings Palace, to the Courts <hi>De La Reine,</hi> or their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Viſits, as all young men of quality are wont, which diſtinguiſhes them from country-Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as much as any other character. And for my own part, when I waited not on them, I
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60933:66"/>haunted all the Fencing Schools and play hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes perpetually, which was perhaps one means to make me become a tolerable Actor. <hi>Verville</hi> took me aſide one day, and confeſſed to me, he was hugely in love with a Gentlewoman that dwelt in the ſame ſtreet. He told me, ſhe had a Brother, by name <hi>Saldaigne,</hi> who was as jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous both of her, and another ſiſter under his tuition, as if he had been their husband, and moreover, he ſaid, he had made no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle progreſs in his Amours, having gained her conſent to give him a meeting in their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by night, the door of the garden looking towards the fields as that of our houſe did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Having diſcovered this ſecret to me, he intreated me to accompany him, conjuring me to get as much as I could poſſibly in the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans favour that attended her. I could not reaſonably refuſe a man I was ſo vaſtly indebted too: So we went forth of our back door, about ten a clock at night, and were admitted to the Garden where the Miſtris and her woman wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for us. The poor Innocent Lady, trembled like a leaf, and could not ſpeak, <hi>Vervilles</hi> cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage was but little better, the waiting woman was mute, and I who onely came to accompany <hi>Verville</hi> ſpake nothing neither, nor had any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to twattle. At laſt <hi>Verville</hi> took hearty grace, and led his Miſtris into a by alley, having firſt charged the waiting woman and my ſelf to play the Centries part, which, we obſerved ſo religiouſly, that for a long time we walked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without opening our lips or moving our
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60933:66"/>tongues. At the end of our walk we met with the young pair of Lovers: <hi>Verville</hi> asked me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, whether I had Courted Madam <hi>Maudlin</hi> as the deſerved: I replyed, that I thought ſhe had no reaſon to complain, <hi>no, in troth,</hi> anſwered the <hi>Laſs,</hi> for as yet he hath not troubled me with a word; <hi>Verville</hi> laughed at her words, and aſſured <hi>Mandlin,</hi> that I was worth her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, though I were ſomewhat Melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by nature. Madam <hi>Saldagne,</hi> ſaid likewiſe, that her woman was not to be diſpiſed, and thereupon they left us again, onely bidding us be ſure, that no body came to ſurprize them. I then prepared to have my ears grated by a waiting woman, whom I expected would now examine me about my wages, what acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance I held amongſt the Chamber-maids in that Pariſh, how many new ſongs I could ſing, or furniſh her in writing, and ſuch other like trifling queſtions. After this, though I, ſhe will diſcover the ſecrets and intrigue of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and lay open her Maſters and Ladies ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, or defects, according as ſhe likes the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſhe is entred into: For there are few ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that meet and do not ſlander or applaud their Maſters, and tell what little regard they have either of their own Fame, or their ſervants wages unleſs they miſtruſt the Fidelity of the hearers, which makes them ſlatter more, and abuſe them more groſly. But I was amazed at the diſcourſe of one, that began thus, <hi>I conjure thee, thou dumb Spirit, to tell me whether thou art a Servant or not, and if thou art a Servant, by what
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60933:67"/>rare Vertue thou haſt refrained thus long, from ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering thy Master?</hi> To hear a Chamber-maid ſpeak ſo extraordinarily, ſurpriſed me much: and made me ask her, <hi>by what Authority ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to exorciſe me?</hi> I <hi>perceive,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>thou art a ſtubborn Spirit, and dost require a double conjurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Tell me therefore Rebellious Spirit, by the Power is given me over all Proud and ſelf-conceited Serving-men, tell me what thou art? I am a poor young fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> replied I, <hi>that would fain be now a ſleep in my bed. It will be no eaſie thing to ſift thee out,</hi> purſued ſhe; <hi>but yet thus much I cleerly diſcover already, that thou haſt little of a courtier in thee;</hi> for added ſhe, <hi>ſhould not you have firſt broken ſilence to me by an humble addreſs, then have taken me by the Lilly hand, ſhot a Legion of Amorous Bolts and Sentences, prated impertinently, strugled for a kiſs, and attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſtorm my breaſt, till you had been beaten off with a ſound cuff or two on the ear, as many kicks in the britch, and ſcratches over the noſe, and then have returned home, with theſe ſcars of Honour, Love, and Fortune</hi> De la Guerre. <hi>There are ſome ſuch maids in</hi> Paris, indeed, ſaid I, <hi>from whom I ſhould take all theſe little affronts, as favours, and bleſſe the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cruel hands that gave them; but there are others too, that I ſhould dread to look upon, for fear of dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſterwards of the Devil. What you hint</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that I perhaps am one of thoſe</hi> Scare-Crows; <hi>but good</hi> Maſter-Hard-To Pleaſe, <hi>or Master</hi> Sweet-Lips, <hi>do not you remember the old ſaying, that</hi> All Cats are grey in the dark. <hi>Yes,</hi> but replied I, <hi>we muſt not therefore venture to do that in the dark,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60933:67"/>whereof we may have cauſe to repent when the light ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears But if I be handſom</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>what then? Then I have ſhewed you leſs reſpect then you deſerve</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed I; <hi>for if your beauty be equall to the charmes of your wit, you deſerve not onely common Courtſhip, but adoration, that is in a formal way, according to the modern rules. And could you ſerve a Lady according to the rules in faſhion,</hi> Said ſhe? <hi>Better then any man living</hi> replied I, <hi>provided I loved her. What's matter for that,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>ſo ſhe fancy you. Nay both muſt joyn Iſſue where I engage,</hi> replied <hi>I Well tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> ſaid ſhe <hi>If we may judge of the Maſter, by the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving man, then hath my Miſtris made no ill choice in</hi> Monſieur Verville, <hi>and that waiting-maid that could ſmite you, would have no little cauſe to be proud of her purchaſe. 'Tis not enough to hear me only,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>you muſt ſee me too. I believe either may be better let alone,</hi> replies ſhe. <hi>Here our converſation ended;</hi> For <hi>Monſieur Saldagn</hi> knocked aloud at the ſtreet door, which they made no over-great haſte to open, that his ſiiſter might have time to ſlip up into the Chamber. The poor Lady and her woman went away in ſuch haſte and diſorder, that they had not the leiſure to bid us adieu when they turned us forth of the Garden. <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> would needs have me go along with him to his Chamber, when we got home. I never ſaw a man ſo much in love, and ſo well pleaſed. He extolled the Wit of his Miſtris, and told me, he ſhould never be ſatisfied, till I had ſeen her. In fine, he kept me there all night, repeating e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing over and over ſo often, that I could
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60933:68"/>get no time to ſleep, till it was juſt break of day. For my own part, I admired to have met with ſuch excellent witty diſcourſe in a waiting maid, and I muſt confeſs I had a kind of an itching de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee, whether ſhe were handſome or not, though the memory of my <hi>Leonora,</hi> made me very indifferent towards all the good faces I had ſeen in <hi>Paris. Monſieur Verville,</hi> and I, ſlept till it was noon. As ſoon as he waked, he wrote to Madam <hi>Saldagne,</hi> and ſent the Letter by his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had carried ſeveral others, having a kind of correſpondency with her Woman. This fellow was of lower <hi>Brittanie</hi> of a very ill ſhape, and a worſe brain. It came into my thoughts, when I ſaw him going, that if the party, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Waiting Gentlewoman, or Chamber maid for I knew not which, whom I had entertained with diſcourſe; ſhould ſee him in that rugged ſhape, and ſpeak with him a while, that certainly ſhe would not miſtake him, for the perſon that waited on <hi>Verville.</hi> This great ſot did his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage well enough for a ſot, he found Madam <hi>Saldagn</hi> with her elder Siſter; named Madam <hi>Lery,</hi> to whom ſhe had imparted the affection ſhe had for <hi>Verville.</hi> As he was waiting for an anſwer, they heard <hi>Monſieur Saldagan</hi> ſinging on the ſtairs. He was coming to his ſiſters chamber, who haſtily conveyed the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Ambaſſador into a cloſe-ſtool room; The Brother made no long abode, ſo the <hi>Brittain</hi> was let out of the gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room again. Madam <hi>Saldagn</hi> locked her ſelf up in her Cloſet a while, to write an anſwer to the Epiſtle, and Madam <hi>Lery</hi> talked with the <hi>Bittain,</hi>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:60933:68"/>whoſe converſation, I doubt prov'd but very dul. Her ſiſter having ended her letter, releaſed her from our clown, ſending him back with a Tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, wherein ſhe promiſed to meet him that night at the ſame time and place as before. As ſoon as it was night, you may believe that <hi>Verville</hi> was ready to go to the place aſſigned. We en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Garden, and I was appointed to the like duty, I had before performed with the ſame Gentlewoman, that talked ſo wittily. She ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed more wit this ſecond time, then ſhe had at firſt, and both her accent and manner of ſpeech was ſo taking, that I heartily wiſhed ſhe might have a face as beautifull, as her tongue was charming. In the mean while, ſhe could not believe me to be the Letter-carrier ſhe had ſeen, nor could imagine why I ſhould have ſo much more judgment by night then by day: Which I impoſed upon her, for having heard the fellow relate the paſſage of <hi>Monſieur Saldagnes</hi> coming to the Chamber, when he was fain to be thruſt in a corner, I plaid upon her with it, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her that I was not then in ſo much fear for my ſelf, as for Madam <hi>Saldagne.</hi> This put it but of all diſpute that I was the ſame ill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured Rogue, and I obſerved that afterwards, he began indeed, to treat me Chamber-maid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60933:69"/>like an unjuſt Father, but rather like a hair-brain'd jealous husband. I was about to take my turn, and tell her a ſtory of the Baron <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Arques,</hi> and his children, when the garden door which we had not bolted, was thrown open, and in comes <hi>Monſieur Saldagn</hi> with two Foot-men, the one carried a lighted Torch in his hand. He came from a houſe which ſtood in the ſame row, where they gamed every day, a place frequenced by Saint <hi>Far,</hi> They had both plaid there that evening, and <hi>Saldagn</hi> having ſoon loſt his money, was comming home by his back door, contrary to his cuſtome, and there ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized us, as I told you, finding the gate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhut. We were at that time all four of us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a cover'd walk, which gave us opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſhun his ſight. The Gentlewoman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there upon pretence of taking the freſh Air, and to give it the better Colour, began to ſing, though againſt her will, as you may eaſily believe. In the interim <hi>Verville</hi> having ſcalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do'd the wall, jumped down; But a third foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that was but coming in, ſeeing him leap, failed not to run and give his Maſter notice, he had ſeen a man leap down the Garden wall as he came in. At the ſame inſtant I fell down back wards with a great noiſe of ſtones and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh, which <hi>Verville</hi> having looſened at his firſt going over, brake down and brought we with it on the Earth. This noiſe together with the fellows tale, alarm'd all thoſe that were in the garden; <hi>Saldagn</hi> haſtens to the ſaid place fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by his three men, and ſpying a man with

We did not think it neceſſary to look after him any more, but minded our own eſcape with all the haſt we could. <hi>Saldagnes</hi> Siſter, whom I ſaw, knowing her Brothers raſh and violent humour, ſtept to us, and begged of us ſoftly, and with many tears, that we would take her along too. <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>

With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our own Garden, there was a little pretty Summer-Houſe painted and nearly adorned; where they did ſometimes eat in hot weather, ſtanding at ſome diſtance from the body of the Great Houſe.

His Brother, Saint <hi>Far,</hi> Anſwered; It is I, what the Devil do you here in the dark, at this time of night? I am talking here with <hi>Gariguez,</hi> ſaid <hi>Verville,</hi> becauſe I am not yet ſleepy. The ſame reaſon brought me hither too, replyes he, therefore pray eave me in this room a while to my ſelf.

And can ſhe be there ſtill, replied I, and in my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber too? would ſhe were ſo ſafe, ſaid he, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Surely you rave replied I. No I neither rave nor dream, ſaid he; We have brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way her elder ſiſter inſtead of her, ſaid he? why, replied I, were not you both in the Garden to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? nothing's more certain, ſaid he, and why will you return thither to endanger your ſelf afreſh, ſaid I? ſince ſhe that was in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with you, is now ſafe in my Chamber: Ha <hi>Gariguez,</hi> cries he again, I know what I ſaw:
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60933:72"/>and ſo do I likewiſe, ſaid I, and to prove your miſtake, do but come up, and ſee Madam <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagne,</hi> whom I have ſecured. He told me I was an aſſe and came after me with the greateſt trouble in the world. My aſtoniſhment was no leſs then his grief, when I found the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in my Chamber, not the ſame I ſaw and brought from the other houſe. <hi>Verville</hi> was as much amazed as my ſelf: but more ſatisfied by farr, knowing this to be his Miſtris contrary to expectation. He then confeſſed his own miſtake, but I could make no anſwer, as not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend by what Magick one Lady whom I had ſeen and followed all the while, ſhould be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to another whom I never beheld till now, and all this in the time we went from the Summer houſe to the Chamber. I looked ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly upon <hi>Vervills</hi> Miſtris, and was certain ſhe was not the ſame, that I brought with me from <hi>Saldagnes. Verville</hi> ſeeing me ſo attentive, what's the matter, ſays he; I confeſs again, that it is my ſelf was miſtaken. Nay it is I, rather, am deceived moſt, if Madam <hi>Saldagne</hi> came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long hither with us, ſaid I: With whom could ſhe come elſe, replies he? I know not, nor no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy elſe, ſaid I, unleſs ſhe diſcover it her ſelf. Nor can I tell, with whom I came my ſelf, ſaid ſhe, unleſs it were with that Gentleman, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, for it was not you <hi>Monſieur Verville</hi> that brought me off: It was a man, that came into the Garden, immediately after you went firſt out of it; ſummoned there I ſuppoſe either by my brothers means or the foot mens out-cryes,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60933:73"/>which alarmed him no doubt, and gave him notice of what had paſſed. He cauſed my brother to be carried into his Chamber, and my wating-woman, having related this to me, and aſſured me he was of my brothers acquaintance, and a neighbour as ſhe perceived by his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the ſervants; I went and ſtaid for him at the Garden door, where I conjured him to take me away with him till the next day, that I could finde conveniency to retire to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of mine, where I would ſtay till my brothers fury was over, which I told him I had reaſon to dread above all the things in the world. This perſon very civily proffer'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct me whither I would, and engaged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect me from my brothers wrath, to the utmoſt of his power. Under his conduct I came to this houſe; where I heard <hi>Verville,</hi> whoſe voice I knew, ſpeak to the ſame party, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after I was brought up to this ſame cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where you now ſee me. This relation of Madam <hi>Saldagnes,</hi> though it did not clear all my doubt, yet it diſcovered ſo much, that it made me gueſs how it was brought about. As for <hi>Vervills</hi> part, he was ſo buſie in gazing upon his dear Miſtris, that he ſcarce minded what ſhe ſaid. He began to Court her with a many fine expreſſions, never examining how ſhe came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But I took a Candle, and leaving them together, went back to the little Garden-houſe, reſolving to ſpeak with Saint. <hi>Far,</hi> though he ſhould be as captious as ever. But I woudred, in ſtead of him, to finde the ſame Gentlewoman
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60933:73"/>there, whom I was certain I brought my ſelf out of the next Garden, and that which encreaſed my wonder, was to ſee her in as much diſorder, as if ſome violence had been offered to her; her head attire torn off, and her night handkerchief bloody in ſome parts of it, as her face was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. <hi>Verville,</hi> ſaid ſhe, as ſoon as I appeared, <hi>Do n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Is this the Noble, the Paſſionate Love you profeſſed towards my Sister? O how dear do's my complyance with her follyes cost me? but when we act the things we ſhould not, it is but just we ſhould feel the ſmart of what we ever most abhor. But what dost thou now meditate;</hi> purſued ſhe, perceiving my aſtoniſhment: <hi>Doeſt thou repent thy baſeneſs, if thou doeſt it heartily, I can as readily forgive thy violence. Thou art but young, and it was my own weakneſſe tempted thee, by putting my ſelf into the hands of ſo unfit a Guardian.

We were not deceived, in our conjectures; Saint <hi>Far</hi> had been gaming in the very ſame houſe where <hi>Saldagne</hi> loſt his money, and paſſing by the Garden a little after the ſcuffle was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he met with <hi>Saldagnes</hi> Footman, who told him what had befallen his Maſter, whom he ſwore had been ſet upon by eight or nine Thieves, thinking thereby to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe his own cowardize, in running from the Fray. Saint <hi>Far</hi> thought himſelf obliged to proffer his ſervice to his Neighbour, and did not leave him, till Y.e had helpt him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his bed-chamber, after which he met Madam <hi>Saldagne</hi> at the Garden door, Who intreated him to carry her ſomewhere in ſafety from her Brothers fury, which cauſed him to conduct her, as we had done her Siſter.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60933:75"/>He intended therefore to ſecure her in the ſame place we had deſigned for the other, as you may have read before; and being as much afraid leaſt we ſhould diſcover his Lady, as we were carefull he might not ſee ours, the two Siſters by this accident, meeting together, juſt as he was coming in, and we going out; I hapned in the dark to catch his Lady by the hand, whilſt he laid hold by a like miſtake upon mine, and thus the women were exchanged. Which was the eaſilier done by reaſon it was very dark, and they ſo terribly affrighted at the late accidents, they knew not what they did in the hurry.

Upon this the Organs changed their Tone, and ſung ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther zealous Anthem with the like skill. None of the hearers had yet ſpoken a word, for fear of interrupting their Melody; but at laſt <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,</hi> who could not tye up his tongue, though his life lay on it, bawl'd out aloud. What do they uſe to ſing Divine Service here in the ſtreet? This ſhews a Zeal to ſome Tune, I-faith, ſays another. 'Tis a nightly Proceſſion adds a third. They have robed ſome Chappel of the Organs, purſues a fourth, and are now ſinging their thankful Mattins to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil their maſter. In fine, every one that looked our, had ſome merry ſaying or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon this ſubject, none neither know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or imagining who ſhould be the ſimple Author of that ridiculous freak. Mean time the Muſick went along playing: When, ſuch a Baggage is blinde Fortune, nine or ten great Dogs, were ſent by her to hunt after a proud Bitch, who taking ſhelter betwixt the Muſitians Leggs, to ſave her ſelf from a rope, and theſe hot ſpirited Rival fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing her cloſe at heels, and quarrelling
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60933:80"/>as Rivals are wont to do for their Miſtris, after ſome grumbling, ſnarling and grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Teeth; they fell together by the ears of a ſudden, with ſo much fury and animoſity, that the poor fellows to ſave their ſhins ran all away, and left their Engine to the mercy of the Dogs; whilſt thoſe immoderate Lovers were ſo uncivil, in the heat of their ſcuffle as to throw down the Harmonious Machine with the Frame that ſupported it, and I ſhould be loath to ſwear that ſome of them did not lift up a legg and piſſe upon the Reverend Orgains when the Fray was ended, thoſe creatures being extreamly diuretick natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; but eſpecially when the ſmell of an Amorous Miſtris tells them ſhe is in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to proceed to the multiplication of her ſpecies. The Conſort being thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, mine Hoſt made them open his door, and would needs ſecure the Organs and Frame from further miſchief. Whilſt he and his ſervants were doing their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable office; The Organiſt returns to his Inſtrument, accompanyed with three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, amongſt whom were a Man with a Woman under his Cloak. This Man was the very <hi>Ragotin</hi> himſelf, who would needs beſtow a Serenade upon Madam <hi>Star,</hi> and to that purpoſe had hyred a little Eunuch, who was an Organiſt, belonging to the Church: And this was the Monſter, being neither man,

Tis you then, it ſeems, Monſieur <hi>Ragotin,</hi> that come with your Veſpers to my Gate, it had been wiſelier done to have kept your folly at home, then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb my Gueſts at this time of Night. <hi>Ragotin</hi> replyed, that he was miſtaken in his man; but yet ſpoke it ſo, as if he intended to diſcover what he ſeemed to deny. But, infine, the Organiſt ſeeing his Inſtrument much impaired, being a Cholerick creature, as all Beardleſſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals are wont to be, ſwore to <hi>Ragotin</hi> that he ſhould pay for the repairing of them. <hi>Ragotin</hi> replyed, that he ſhould laugh at that.

               <p>THe next day the Comedians met together, in one of thoſe Chambers they had at the Inn, to rehearſe the Comedy they were to Act that afternoon. <hi>RANCO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R,</hi> to whom <hi>ROGOTIN</hi> had already diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſecret of his Serenade, which he ſeemingly made ſome difficulty to believe, told his Companions, that the little fellow would not fail to be there ſuddenly to receive their thanks and applauſe, for his ſo refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a peece of Courtſhip, and maliciouſly
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60933:81"/>intreated them, that when ever he hinted it, they would take no notice of it, but put him off with ſome other diſcourſe. <hi>RAGOTIN</hi> came into the Room at the ſame inſtant, and having ſaluted the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in general, began to mention ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Serenade to Madam <hi>STAR,</hi> who proved at that time a meer wandring Star to her poor Love; ſtill removing from place to place while <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This made him leave her, and addreſſe himſelf to Madam <hi>AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GELICA,</hi> who inſtead of replying to him, repeated the Part ſhe had to Act in the Play. He goes to <hi>CAVE</hi> next, but ſhe would not afford him ſo much as one look. After this it came to the mens tune, who, every one of them, exactly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved what <hi>RANCO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R</hi> injoyned, and either anſwered nothing to his dull que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions; or ſhot as wide from the Marke as if he had talked quite of another thing. At length being impatient to proclaim his vanity, he thus ſpake aloud to them all. Will you give me leave to confeſſe a great truth to you. You may do what you pleaſe, replyed one: VVhy, then, ſaid he, you muſt know it was I that gave you the laſt nights Serenade. What, do they
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60933:82"/>give Serenades with Organs in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſaid <hi>DESTINY?</hi> and to whom did you intend it? Was it not, purſued he, to the fair Lady that ſet the Dogs together by the Ears. No doubt, ſaid <hi>OLIVE;</hi> for thoſe quarrelſome Puppies would never have diſturbed ſuch Harmonious Muſicians, had they not been <hi>Monſieur RAGOTINS</hi> jealous Rivals. Another of the Company would needs have a fling at him too, and ſaid without doubt he is highly in his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies favour, and means nothing but what is fair and honeſt, ſince he Courts in the open ſtreets, nor can he chuſe but ſucceed, when his Voices and Inſtrument are a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree above howling. In fine, every one had a ſaying, except <hi>RANCO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R</hi> who ſpared him, being his Confident; and it is likely the Raillery had continued; if the Poet who was as Vain and Ridiculous an Aſſe as <hi>RAGOTIN,</hi> had not taken them off, by telling them; Now you ſpeak of Serenades, I remember that when I was Married, I had one beſtowed upon me, that laſted a fortnight together, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of a hundred ſeveral ſorts of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ranged all over the Marets; The Greateſt Gallants and Ladies of the Place Royal adopted it: Divers perſons of Quality aſſumed the Honour of it, nay and a Great Man, that ſhall be nameleſs now, took ſuch a fit of jealouſie upon it, that he
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60933:82"/>made his Servants ſet upon thoſe that did it onely for my ſake. But they met with their Match; For theſe were all my own Country-men, as brave Fellows as ever piſs'd againſt a Wall; and the moſt of them had been Officers of a Regiment I raiſed, in the laſt Rebellion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. <hi>RANCO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R,</hi> who had bridled his biting Tongue in favour of <hi>RAGO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIN,</hi> could not poſſibly forbear the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, whom he perpetually plagued; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he took up the Cudgels againſt this Darling of the Muſes, and told him, that the Deſcription he had made of this Fiction, ſounded more of Bedlam or the proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Rams-Horns, then any thing of Gallantry, and ſo probably importuned the Perſon of Quality rather to drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the horrid noiſe of diſturbing him then any thing elſe.

Nay but ſhe dyed of a fit of the Mother, ſaid the Poet. It was rather a fit of the Great Great Grand-mother, replied <hi>RAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R:</hi> For in the beginning of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Fourth's Raign, ſhe had Grand-Children enough to have made up the

But the Poet who dreaded him extreamly, interrupted him, ſaying, I will wager a hundred Piſtols on the contrary: which abrupt defiance, ſet all the company a laughing. Yet this was his conſtant cuſtome, having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhift but ſuch like wagers to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his daily Hyperboles, which amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the weakly ſumm of a Thouſand or Twelve Hundred impertinencies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the innumerable down-right lyes he vented into the bargain. Now <hi>RAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R</hi> was the Controuler-General as well of his Words as Actions, and the aſcendent he had over him, was ſo great, that I dare compare it to the Genius of <hi>A<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>G<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ST<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> over <hi>ANTHONY'S,</hi> that is to ſay, like to like, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring

But he excuſed himſelf for that time, promiſing a fitter ſeaſon to give them a faithfull account of the Poets whole life, wherein his Wives ſhould be likewiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. It was now high time, to reherſe their parts, of a Play, which was to be Acted that ſame day in a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Tennis-Court, nothing worth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation hapned at the Rehearſal. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dinner they Acted for good and all, and came off with applauſe. Madam <hi>STAR</hi> Charmed the Audience with her Beauty, <hi>ANGELICA</hi> had her Partiſans too, and both of them gave the World a great deal of ſatisfaction in what they undertook. <hi>Deſtiny</hi> and his Comrades did wonderfully well, inſomuch, that many who had ſeen the Kings Players, atteſted they could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have Acted it better. <hi>Ragotin</hi> in his heart and mind, ratified the donative he had made of his Body and Soul to Madam <hi>Star,</hi> in preſence of <hi>Rancour,</hi> who engaged he would bring him in favour with his Miſtris: Without this promiſe, Diſpair had ſoon made of this little Pittifull Advocate, the ſubject of ſome great Tragical Event.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60933:84"/>I cannot tell whether the Women pleaſed the Ladies of the Town in their Acting, ſo much as the Men pleaſed their own Sex: But if I did know the truth of it, I ſhould hardly diſcover it: And ſince the wiſeſt Man, is not alwayes able to bridle his own tongue; I ſhall conclude this preſent Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to avoid all occaſions of further tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on this ſubject.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> The ill ſucceſs of <hi>Ragotins</hi> Civility.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS ſoon as <hi>Destiny</hi> had ſtripped himſelf of his old Embrodery, and put on his ordinary wearing Apparel, <hi>la Rappiniere</hi> led him to the Common-Goal, becauſe the Man they had taken, that day the Curate of <hi>Domfront</hi> was ſet upon in the high-way, deſired to ſpeak with him. In the mean time the Actreſſes went home to their Inn, with a great Train of Citizens. <hi>Ragotin</hi> hapning to be neer <hi>Cave</hi> when ſhe came forth of the Tennis-Court, where the Play was Acted, proffered her his hand to lead her to her Lodgings, though he would rather have waited on his Dear <hi>Star,</hi> he did the like to <hi>Angelica,</hi> ſo that he was Squire to the right and left. This double civility, begot a treble inconvenience, For <hi>Cave</hi> having the upper hand, as was fit, was crowded to the Wall by <hi>Ragotin,</hi> that <hi>Angelica</hi> might not be forced to walk in the Kennel: Beſides, this little Dwarf, reaching no higher then their waſts, pulled
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60933:85"/>down their hands ſo much, they could ſcarce keep themſelves for tumbling over him: But that which moſt troubled them was, his often looking over his ſhoulder to ſtare upon Madam <hi>Star,</hi> who was talking to a pair of Fantaſtical Fellows, that would by all means lead her through the ſtreets againſt her will. The poor Women endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured many times to get looſe from their ſmall Gentleman-Uſher; But he gripped them ſo hard, their fingers ends tingled again. They intreated him often to ſpare himſelfe that labour; He onely anſwered them, your Servant, your Servant, (his ordinary Complement) and gripped them ſtill harder and harder. They were fain to be patient therefore, till they came to the foot of their Chamber ſtairs, where they hoped to be ſet at liberty: But <hi>Ragotin</hi> was no flincher, repeating onely your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, your Servant to all they could plead, he endeavoured at firſt to go up with them a breaſt, which he found not feiſible; Then <hi>Cave</hi> turned her back towards the wall, and crept up ſide-long, dragging <hi>Ragotin</hi> after her, who haled up <hi>Angelica</hi> in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſhe laughing all the while like a little fool. Now to make up the misfortune, when they were within five or ſix ſteps of their Chamber, down comes a man with a huge ſack of Oates on his back, who with much adoe, ſo heavy was his load, bids
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60933:85"/>them go down again, for he could not turn about with his burthen. <hi>Ragotin</hi> would needs diſpute it; the Fellow bluntly ſwore he would throw down his Oates up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. This made them go back again a little faſter then they went up, but <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotin</hi> would not let go his hold. The man with the Oates preſſed haſtily upon them, which cauſed <hi>Ragotin</hi> to miſſe a ſtep, ſo that he hung in the aire by the hand, it being out of his reach to the next ſtair, till he pulled down <hi>Cave</hi> upon him, who cruſhing him down with her weight, ſhe lighted with her feet on the Pigmeys belly and breaſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60933:87"/>look about, having no reaſon to think they ſpoke of me; and yet I was the ſubject of their diſcourſe it ſeems: For I preſently found the ſick Lady was Madam <hi>Boiſſiere,</hi> grown very pale and wan, who reſted upon her daughters ſhoulder. This made me go directly towards them, with more confidence then I had done at <hi>Rome,</hi> having ſomewhat improved my ſelf in my carriage during my late abode at <hi>Paris.</hi> It put them to ſuch a fright and amazement, that I verily believe they would have fled from me, had Madam <hi>de la Boiſſiere</hi> been able to run, and this ſurpriſed me no leſs. I asked them what happy ſtar brought me to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of two perſons whom I eſteemed above all the World.

They grew ſad at theſe words, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd the Mother began to expreſs a great deal of tenderneſs towards me, which I knew not how to interpret. At laſt ſhe diſcovered the ground of this civility; ſhe found me in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60933:88"/>to ſerve her, and her condition required it; the caſe being otherwiſe now, then when ſhe made her Grimaſſes at <hi>Rome.</hi> They had met with misfortunes which put them to a ſtreight: For having turned all their Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-ſtuff into money, which amounted to a conſiderable ſum; they parted from <hi>Rome</hi> with a <hi>French</hi> Chamber-Maid that had ſerved them a long time, and Signor <hi>Stephano</hi>'s <hi>Valet,</hi> a <hi>Fleming</hi> like himſelf, who would needs return to his native ſoil. The Fellow and Wench it ſeems loved each other enough to venture a Marriage, and yet their buſineſs was ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, that no body ever diſcovered the leaſt ſpark of their mutual flame. Madam <hi>Boiſſiere</hi> being come to <hi>Roüane,</hi> went by water thence. At <hi>Newers</hi> ſhe found her ſelf ſo ill, that ſhe could go no further. In the time of her ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhe was ſomewhat hard to be pleaſed, and her Maid more unwilling to endeavour it, then ever ſhe had appeared before. One morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Laſs and her ſweet-heart were miſſing, and which was a great deal worſe, all their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was miſſing too. Her grief increaſed her malady, and ſhe was compelled to ſtay at <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,</hi> till ſhe could get a ſupply from <hi>Paris,</hi> which ſhe expected, to proceed in her Journey. This adventure ſhe related in ſhort, and I led them back again to their Inn, being the ſame where I had taken up my quarters, where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had brought them to their chamber, and ſtaid a while, I retired to my own, leaving them
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60933:88"/>to their ſupper. For my own part, I could not eat a bit, but thought it long till I were with them again. I waited upon them, as ſoon as they had given me notice it was convenient, and found the Mother in bed, the Daughter receiving me with a countenance as ſad, as it appeared joyfull before; Her Mothers grief was increaſed, and that put me into a dumps likewiſe. We ſtared a while upon one another very wildly without ſpeaking a word. At length Madam <hi>de la Boiſſiere</hi> ſhewed me a Letter ſhe had newly received from <hi>Paris,</hi> which made both her, and her Daughter <hi>Leonora</hi> the moſt afflicted couple in the World. She expreſſed this affliction by ſo great an effuſion of tear, which made her Daughter weep ſo bitterly too, that it moved me ſo ſenſibly, I thought I could never expreſs my ſenſe of it enough, though I proffered them all I could poſſibly do for their aſſiſtance, with ſo much freedom as put them out of doubt of my reality. I am ignorant of the cauſe of your grief, ſaid I; but if my life may contribute any thing to your relief, you may ſafely rely upon me: Tell me therefore, Madam, wherein I can ſerve you; Money I have if you want ought; and courage likewiſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue you from the danger of an Enemy, all which I ſhall employ upon no other condition then only the ſatisfaction of doing you ſervice. My countenance gave them ſo full aſſurance; that both my heart and tongue conſented to this propoſition, that it abated the over flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60933:89"/>deluge ſomewhat. Madam <hi>de la Boiſſiere</hi> gave me a Letter to peruſe, wherein a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman of her acquaintance advertized her, that a certain perſon, whom ſhe named not, though I judged it to be <hi>Leonoras</hi> Father, was commanded to leave the Court, and had reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf into <hi>Holland.</hi> So that this poor Lady was left in a ſtrange Country, without either money, or the leaſt hopes of getting any for her ſubſiſtance. I made a ſecond proffer of the ſmall ſtock I had, which might amount to about five hundred Crowns, and told her, I would wait upon her either into <hi>Holland,</hi> or any other corner of the World, ſhe had a mind to go to. In fine, I fully aſſured her, ſhe had retrieved in me, a perſon that would render her the ſervices ſhe could expect from the meaneſt Valet, by whom ſhe ſhould finde her ſelf reſpected and obey'd, as if I were her Son. I bluſhed extreamly when I told her this: But I was not now ſo hateful as at <hi>Rome,</hi> when they denied themſelves, and dwelt inviſible, the fair <hi>Leonora</hi> appearing much more civil, the Mother leſs ſevere. At every proffer I made, ſhe ſtill replyed, <hi>Leonora</hi> would be engaged to me: So that all was ſcored on <hi>Leonoras</hi> account, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that one would have taken her Mother to have been only a waiting woman, that ſpoke in her Miſtriſſes behalf: ſo great a truth it is the World reſpects people only according to their own intereſt. I left them very well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and got to my Chamber the moſt content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60933:89"/>man that could be. The night paſſed over very happily, though I ſlept not at all, which kept me ſomewhat late in bed, being a little drowfie about break of day. <hi>Leonora</hi> trickt up her ſelf with more curioſity then the day before, and could not but obſerve I had done the like. I led her to Maſs without her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was as yet too weak to go abroad. We dined together, and afterwards were of one Family. Madam <hi>de la Boiſſiere</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the ſervices I rendered them, and vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe would not dye my debtor. I ſold my Horſe, and no ſooner was the ſick patient, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, but we took a little boat and went down to <hi>Orleans.</hi> During the time of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, I enjoyed my <hi>Leonoras</hi> converſation, and was not interrupted by her Mother. I found her wit, as ſprightly and charming as her looks, nor had ſhe reaſon to think mine ſo dull, as ſhe found it at <hi>Rome,</hi> which made her take a greater delight in the diſcourſe I often entertained her with. What can I ſay more, in ſhort, ſhe was taken as much with me, as I was captivated by her, and you may wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ever ſince we have been here together, how little this reciprocal affection is diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. What ſaid <hi>Angelica,</hi> interrupting him, Is Madam <hi>Star</hi> that <hi>Leonora?</hi> Who elſe? replyed <hi>Destiny.</hi> At which, Madam <hi>Star</hi> was pleaſed to ſay, her friend had reaſon to queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe were that <hi>Leonora,</hi> whom <hi>Deſtiny</hi> had deſcribed ſo advantageouſly. It is not
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60933:90"/>upon that account I ſtart the queſtion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Angelica;</hi> But we are ever moſt in doubt of what we moſt deſire. Madam <hi>Cave,</hi> added, that for her part, ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of this from the beginning, but deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to wave that diſcourſe, till <hi>Deſtiny</hi> had compleated his ſtory; who went on thus. We arrived at <hi>Orleans,</hi> where our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance was ſo pleaſant as will deſerve a particular Relation. A throng of fellows who always wait in expectation of ſtrangers; at the Water-ſide, to carry home their Goods, crowded into our little Bark. There were at leaſt Thirty that took up two or three little bundles betwixt them, which the weakeſt of thoſe lazy Knaves might have carried ſingly under one arme. Had I been alone, perhaps I ſhould not have been ſo wiſe as to have ſuffered their inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency. Eight of them lifted up a little box not weighing much above twenty pounds; which they ſeemed to hoyſt from ground with much trouble; and having got it betwixt them, they held it aloft above their heads, upon their fingers ends. The Raſcallity that ſtood by, fell a laughing, and we were glad to do the like: however it made me bluſh for ſhame to go all thorow the Town with ſuch a retinue: For the reſt of our bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage which would not have loaden one Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, had twenty at leaſt, my very Piſtols being borne in ſtate by four luſty raſcalls, two hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60933:90"/>each of them a Piſtol, and the other two ſhe Holſters. So this was our order we march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>d along in, eight Drunken Whoreſons, or ſuch as deſerved no better Title, as I told you before, carried the little Box. My Piſtols and Holſters followed them two by two. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de la Boiſſiere,</hi> no leſs vexed at it then my ſelf went next to thoſe; Being carried in a great Wicker Chair faſtned to a couple of Cowl-ſtaves, and ſupported by four Water-men, who relieved one another by turns, and went along parting a hundred impertinencies, to her, on the way: the reſt of our goods came after her, being only a little Portmanteau, and a bundle covered with Canvas, which nine or ten of theſe Villains toſſed from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the way. And I brought up the rear of this Regiment of Rogues, holding <hi>Leonora</hi> by the hand, who laughed ſo heartily to ſee this pleaſant proceſſion, that I could not but be delighted as well as vexed with the Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery. In our March, the paſſengers ſtood ſtill gazing upon us, and ſhouted ſo loud, that it ſummoned all the people to their windows and doors. At laſt we arrived at the <hi>Fanxbourgh,</hi> on the road towards <hi>Paris,</hi> attended with a huge train of idle perſons, and took up our Lodging at the ſign of the <hi>Emperours Head.</hi> I put the women into a lower room, and went forth and threatned the drones ſo ſeriouſly, that they were contented to take very little pay for their great labour, the Land-Lord and his Wife ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60933:91"/>my part againſt them. Madam <hi>de la Boiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiere</hi> whom the money I had furniſhed her with, ſooner cured then all the Cordials beſides could have done, found her ſelf able in a ſhort time to travel by Coach, wherefore I took up three places in one, that was to go the next morning, and within two dayes after, we came in ſafety to <hi>Paris.</hi> Coming out of the Coach, I made acquaintance with <hi>Rancour,</hi> who came from <hi>Orleans</hi> in another Coach at the ſame time as ours. He heard me inquire for the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais</hi> Coach-Houſe, and told me he muſt go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imediately, and if we had not made choice of any particular Lodging, he would bring us to a Womans of his acquaintance, that kept Chambers ready furniſhed, where we might be very conveniently. We believed him, and found it as he told us. This Woman was the Widdow of a perſon, that had all his life time belonged to a Play-houſe, ſometimes a Door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, then a Prompter, and afterwards a puny Actor, endeavouring to riſe higher, but wanting fit parts to attain it. Having ſcraped ſome money together at the Theatre, he betook himſelf to houſe-keeping, furniſhed ſeveral Chambers, and hired them out by the week to no little profit. We took a couple of Rooms that were none of the worſt, Madam <hi>de la Boiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiere</hi> was confirmed of the ill news touching <hi>Leonoras</hi> Father, and heard ſo much beſides, though ſhe concealed it from us, that it caſt her upon her ſick bed again. This put off our voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60933:91"/>into <hi>Holland</hi> a while, whither ſhe reſolved to go, and <hi>Rancour</hi> who was to go to the ſame Country to a Company of Players that were there, was contented to wait our leiſure, upon condition I would defray his charges till we were ready. Madam <hi>de la Boiſiere</hi> was frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſited by one of her Fellow Servants that lived at the fame time with her in the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours Family, and had been her chief confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, when <hi>Leonoras</hi> Father was firſt in love. This Woman gave her the account of her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Husbands retirement, and did us many great courteſies during our reſidence at <hi>Paris.</hi> I went out of doors as ſeldome as I could, for fear of being diſcovered by ſome of my friends: and found it no great trouble to ſtay within, ſo long as I had my <hi>Leonora,</hi> and the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ingratiating my ſelf more and more with her Mother. Upon this Womans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, who as I told you, came often to viſit us, we took a walk one morning towards Saint <hi>Clou,</hi> to air and refreſh our ſelves. Our Landlady made up one in the company, and <hi>Rancour</hi> another. We took a Boat when we came to the water ſide; and landed at ſeveral of the faireſt Gardens where we walked and eat and drank, having ſo done, <hi>Rancour</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the Women towards the Boat, whil'ſt I was paying the reckoning at a houſe, where they asked moſt unreaſonable prizes for what we had, and this kept me longer from them, then I intended. I got off as well I could, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60933:92"/>haſted to joyn with my company. But I was hugely aſtoniſhed to ſee the Boat gone a good way from ſhore, carrying my friends towards <hi>Paris,</hi> and leaving me behind, without any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, or ſo much as my Foot-Boy that had my Sword to wait upon me, ſtanding at the River ſide, ſomewhat troubled at their ſtrange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; I heard a great uproar in another. Boat that lay there, and drawing ſomewhat near, I perceived two or three Gentlemen, or perſons that appeared to be ſuch, who would needs fall foul of a Waterman, becauſe he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to go after our Boat. I leap'd into this Boat at all adventure, juſt as it was launching forth, the man fearing he ſhould be roughly handled: But if I were troubled at the ſudden departure of my friends, I was no leſs perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to finde that he that offered this violence was the ſame <hi>Saldagne,</hi> whom I had ſo much reaſon to hate. At the inſtant I diſcovered him, he removed from the ſame place he ſat in, and came juſt by me: I hid my face from him the beſt I could, But finding him ſo near, that it was impoſſible to conceal my ſelf long, and knowing I had no Sword, I took the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate reſolution that could be, though at that time I judged it the ſafeſt; I ſeized upon him before he could have the time to ſit down, and threw my ſelf into the River with him. He was not able to keep hold of my cloaths, whether his gloves hindred it, or his ſudden ſurpriſal. Never was any man nearer drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60933:92"/>then he. A great many of the neareſt boats came in to ſave him, every one thinking we had fallen into the water accidentally, except <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagn</hi> who knew the truths, but was not in a condition either to diſcover the ſame or purſue me. So I got on land again without much difficulty, having onely a thin ſute on, which did not much hinder my ſwiming, and thinking it worth my labour to make haſt, I got farr enough off from Saint <hi>Clou,</hi> before they finiſh'd up <hi>Saldagne.</hi> As they had no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle adoe to take him out of the River, ſo they had no leſs adoe I dare ſay to believe his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion how I threw him into it; when he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how I ventured my own drowning to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his, which certainly he would not hide from them. I was forced to go a great way about to get into <hi>Paris,</hi> and durſt not enter the City, till Night, having no need of a fire to dry my cloaths, the heat of the ſun and my exerciſe having done that ſufficiently. At length I got to my dear <hi>Leonora</hi>'s, whom I found in great affliction. <hi>Rancour</hi> and our Landlady were over joy'd to ſee me again, and ſo was Madam <hi>De la Boiſſiere</hi> likewiſe, who the better <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60933:93"/>at their going from the Garden houſe, the Gallant followed them to the water ſide; where he uncivily preſſed <hi>Leonora</hi> to unmask her ſelf, and diſcovering him to be the very ſame fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that had attempted the like at <hi>Rome,</hi> they ſhuffled into the Boat without more a doe, and made the Woterman put from the ſhore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately: <hi>Saldagne</hi> having a couple more of the ſame ſtamp come to him, got into the next Boat with his two comrades, where I found him threatning the Watermen to make them purſue us. This adventure made me keep more within doors then I had done formerly. A while after Madam <hi>De la Boiſſiere</hi> fell ſick; her Melancholy contributed much to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, which made us remain part of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at <hi>Paris</hi> by <hi>Perone.

I defended my ſelf the beſt I could, and <hi>Rancour</hi> I proteſt did what man could doe, inſomuch as he ſaved my life: though he could not ſave me from being plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of all I had about me, excepting my doublet and breeches, they having rifled me of an Enamelled box, with <hi>Leonoras:</hi> Fathers

Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>De la Boiſſiere</hi> was very much concerned for the loſſe of the Picture, but the hopes of ſeeing the Original ſhortly, revived her again.

He therefore believed he was admired by all the Players, nay, even by <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour</hi> himſelf, who had experience enough, to admire ſeldome any thing, and was ſo far from having a good opinion of this poor Squire of the <hi>Bay-ſprig,</hi> that he had made a full enquiry of his extraction, thereby to diſcover whether thoſe Biſhops and great Lords his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whom he often quoted for his Kindred, were the true branches of that <hi>Genealogick Tree,</hi> this fool of Arts, and coats of Arms, together with many other things, had cauſed to be drawn in a large skin of Parchment. He was very ſorry to find <hi>Rancour</hi> had company with him, though he had leſs need to be troubled at that then any one beſide, it being his ill cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome to whiper at all times in peoples ears, and often make a great ſecret of nothing. However he took <hi>Rancour</hi> in a corner, and very gravely deſired to know, whether the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Wife was a perſon of much underſtanding or not; becauſe he had loved Women of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions but the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and if ſhe were worth his purchaſe, he ſhould not be much the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er if he preſented her with a hundred Piſtols of Gold, which he as often mentioned on every occaſion, as the great Family from whence he was deſcended. <hi>Rancour</hi> told him, he was not yet ſo intimately acquainted with <hi>Donna Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zilla,</hi> as to give his judgement in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,

                     </gap>re</hi> and <hi>Ragotin,</hi> who were Rivals al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, though unknown to each other. As for old <hi>Rancour,</hi> beſides the propenſity we have to hate any one that endeavours to defeat us of what we deſign for our ſelves, and the general quarrel he had againſt man-kind, he ever had, beſides all this, a particular averſion to this Poet, which this diſcovery was not likely to abate. Wherefore <hi>Rancour</hi> abſolutely reſolv'd, from that time forwards to do him all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief he could poſſibly, to which his Apiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture prompted him, and fitted him for; and not to looſe time, he began that very day, by baſely borrowing money of him, where with he new cloathed himſelf in-ſide and out-ſide
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60933:96"/>from top to toe, with the beſt Linnen and Woollen he could get. He had before, been very ſlovenly all his life time; but love which works far greater miracles, made him grow cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſpruce in his gray years. He changed his Linnen oftner then did become a Country Player, and began to waſh, powder and trim himſelf ſo carefully, that his Companions took notice of it. The Players were that day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken to Act a Comedy, at one of the chiefeſt Citizens belonging to the Town, who made a grand treate, and had a Ball at his Neeces Wedding, whoſe Guardian he had been. The entertainment was made at a very fair Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Houſe of his about a League from the City, but whether Eaſt-ward, Weſt-ward, North-ward, or South-ward, I know not. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Revels, and a Carpenter were ſent in the morning early, to make the Stage. The whole company of Players went afterwards in two Coaches about eleven a clock, that they might get thither by dinner time. Donna <hi>Inezilla</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lady made one at their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt intreaty. <hi>Ragotin</hi> having notice of the buſineſs, went to an Inn where he waited the coming of the Coach, and tyed a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome horſe at the door, which he had borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſome friend. He was ſcarce ſet down to eat his dinner, when they told him the Coach was in ſight. He flew to Horſe upon the wings of Love, with a great Sword by his ſide, and a Carabine dangling at his breech. He would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60933:97"/>confeſs, what his fancy was, to go to a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with ſuch offenſive and defenſive Armes and Amunition; No, not <hi>Rancour</hi> his boſome friend, could ever get him to diſcover it. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving untied his Horſes Bridle, the Coaches were ſo near, that he had not the time to take his advantage, of mounting like a petty Saint <hi>George:</hi> And being none of the beſt Horſemen, nor ſo much minding his getting up hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly, as his doing it ſuddenly, he came blewly off, for this Horſes legs were as much too long for him, as his were too ſhort to ride ſuch a tall beaſt. However he got his foot nimbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtirrop, and threw his right leg over the ſaddle, but the girths were looſe it ſeems, and that ſomewhat troubled him; for this made it run round while he was beſtriding the ſteed, yet all went hitherto well enough, but the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Carabine, which hung on a belt about his neck like a Coller, got ſo unfortunately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his legs e're he was aware, that he could not reach the ſaddle with his breech, by I know not how much, the Carabine lying along on the ridge from the pummel to the crupper, ſo that he was in no great eaſe, as not being able with his duck legs to reach half way down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his ſtirrops; beſides, his heels being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ſpurs, tickled the Horſes ſides in a place he was never wont to be pricked in, which ſet him a going more merrily then was neceſſary for a little Rider in that poſture, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing but the Carabine to reſt upon,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60933:97"/>much like the Wooden Horſe, or Cowl-ſtaff; this made him cling his legs cloſe to the horſes ſides, and that clinging, made him fling up his hinder legs, ſo that <hi>Ragotin</hi> following the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all heavy bodies fell into the horſes neck, with his noſe broken, the beaſt lifting up his head ſuddenly again at a check of the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle he gave him unawares: to repair this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight he lets go the reyns, and gave the Horſe his head, which was no ſooner at liberty but he gives a great leap, and caſts his Squire quite over the ſaddle upon his crupper, with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabine ſtill between his thighs. The horſe not being uſed to carry any thing behind, makes a croupade, which placed <hi>Ragotin</hi> juſt in the ſaddle again. The unskilfull Squire claps his heeles cloſe afreſh, and then the Horſe flung up his hinder legs more then at firſt, which pitch'd the poor fellow juſt with his neck upon the pummel; where we muſt leave him, as on a Pinacle, to reſt our ſelves a little; for on my reputation, this diſcription hath coſt me more pains then all the book be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and yet I am not very well ſatisfied with it my ſelf.</p>

               <p>WE left <hi>Ragotin</hi> planted on the pummel of a ſaddle, much concerned at this miſhap, and as much troubled how to behave himſelf. I ſcarce believe the defunct <hi>Phaeton</hi> of unhappy memory, was more troubled with his Fathers four fiery jades, then our ſmall Advocate with this one Horſe, as quiet as a lamb if he had had but a skilfull Rider; and that he loſt not his life, as <hi>Phaeton</hi> did, he was beholding more to fortune, then any judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own; whoſe ill menage were a fit ſubject for a longer diſcourſe, were I not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience obliged to releaſe him from the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger he was in; having many more things to treat of concerning our Comedians during their reſidence at <hi>Manſe.</hi> As ſoon as <hi>Ragotin</hi> felt what an uneaſie cuſhion he had under the two moſt fleſhy parts of his body, upon which he uſed to fit, as all other rational

                  </gap> the ſame, and ſtumbled ſo rudely, that <hi>Ragotin</hi> loſt his ſeat, and for a time hung by the mane, with one ſpur intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in the ſaddle-cloath, and the reſt of his body hanging towards the earth, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a fall as ſoon as his ſpur ſhould break looſe, together with his Sword and Carabine in his Bandeleer. At length the ſaddle-cloath gave way, his hands let go their hold, and down he fell, but with more eaſe and skill then he got up. All this hapned within ſight of the Coaches, who ſtop'd purpoſely to ſee what would become of him, or rather to have the pleaſure of laughing at him. He curſed the Horſe, who ſtood ſtock ſtill as ſoon as he laid down his load, but to comfort him they took him up into one of the Coaches in the Poets room, who was willing to ride, that he might court and galantize his Miſtris <hi>Inezilla</hi> ſitting in the Boot. <hi>Ragotin</hi> reſigned his Sword and Fire-Armes up to him, which he put on in a very martial poſture. He lengthned the ſtip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rops, fitted the bridle, and no doubt went to get up more methodically then <hi>Ragotin.</hi> But there was ſurely ſome ill fate attended the horſe that day. For the ſaddle being too
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60933:99"/>looſely girted as before turned round with him likewiſe, and the ſtring of his breeches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken, the Horſe ran a pretty way with him, whil'ſt he had but one foot in the ſtirrop, his other ſerving the Horſe for a fifth legg, whil'ſt his back-parts were expoſed to open view, his breeches dangling all the way at his heeles. The Spectators did not laugh very much as <hi>Ragotins</hi> miſhap, becauſe there was more apparent danger in it; But <hi>Rocquebrunes,</hi> was accompanied with loud ſhouts from the Coaches; who ſtood ſtill to obſerve the event, and hallowed with all their might, which drove him into a houſe for ſhelter, leaving the horſe to his own diſcretion, who very wiſely walked back again to the Town. But <hi>Ragotin</hi> knowing he was to be reſponſable for the beaſt, alighted out of the Coach, and went af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him. Then the Poet having caſed up his poſteriours returned to the Players, and rode along in his former ſeat, much troubled with his Martial Equipage, and more troubleſome to the Company which made him declaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Ragotin,</hi> who had undergone this third diſgrace in his Ladies preſence, with which we ſhall conclude our Twentieth Chapter.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THe Players were very civilly received by the maſter of the houſe, who was a good ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, and one of the moſt conſiderable in thoſe parts. They had two chambers allotted them to lay their Cloaths in and attire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the Play, which was put off till after Supper. They dined in private, and after Dinner thoſe that would walk had the liberty of a Grove and a large Garden. A young Counſellor of the Parliament of <hi>Renes,</hi> and neer Kinſman to the maſter of the houſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted our Comedians, and ſtaid ſome time to converſe with them, having diſcovered <hi>Deſtiny</hi> to be a perſon of more then Vulgar judgment, and the women, beſides their beauty to be ſuch as could ſay more then juſt the parts they lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by rote. They diſcourſed of things ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their profeſſion as Players and Poets. The young Counſellor ſaid amongſt other things, that there was ſcarce any remarkable Subject whereof they had not written, ſo that all Hiſtory was, as one may ſay, exhauſted or
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60933:100"/>pumped dry, and therefore Modern Authors would be at length conſtrained to Wave thoſe nice Rules of real ſtories and accidents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in four and twenty hours, it being judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unneceſſary by moſt people that the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre ſhould be confined to ſuch ſevere limits, for ſince the generality are rather pleaſed with repreſentations then recitals, they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive ſuch plots as would be acceptable, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either falling into the <hi>Spaniards</hi> extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies, or tying themſelves up to <hi>Aristotles</hi> ſtrickt rules. From Commedies they fell to talk of Romances. The Counſellor affirmed that nothing could be more divertive then our Modern Romances, wherein the <hi>French</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all other Nations: but for Novels the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> had an art beyond us in contriving thoſe little Hiſtories, which are more uſefull, and more probable patterns for us to follow, then thoſe imaginary Hero's of Antiquity, who are ſomtimes the worſe for being charactred too good. In fine, thoſe examples that are imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, are to be reckoned at leaſt more uſefull, if not more pleaſant, then ſuch as do exceed all probability and belief: And ſo he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that if they could but compoſe as quaint Novels in <hi>French</hi> as thoſe written by <hi>Michael de Cervantes</hi> who ſeldome brought any Princes on the Stage, they would ſoon grow as current as ever Heroick Romances have been. <hi>Rocque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brune</hi> was not of the ſame opinion; He ſaid ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſitively, that there could be no pleaſure
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60933:100"/>in reading of Romances, unleſſe they contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the adventures of Princes, yea and of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Princes too, and for that reaſon, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> pleaſed him onely in ſome parts of it. And in what Hiſtories can one finde Kings and Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours enough to make you new Romances, ſaid the Counſellor: we muſt feign ſuch, replied <hi>Rocquebrune,</hi> as they uſually doe in Fabulous ſtories, which have no foundation but the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per they are built upon. I perceive then, ſaid the Counſellor, that <hi>Don Quixot</hi> is but ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed by you. 'Tis the moſt ſottiſh peece that ere I read, replied he, though many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that pretend to wit have fondly cried it up. Have a care it be not rather want of wit in you, then any defect in the book, that makes you judge ſo raſhly, ſaid <hi>Deſtiny.

He was ſeven or eight days at leaſt, in the Chyrurgions hands, who having no great experience, and his grief not abating, it conſtrained him at length to ſend his Couſin word of his misfortune, and withal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat him to procure a Horſe-Litter for him that he might get to <hi>Madrid.</hi> The news of his fall affrighted them no leſs, then the knowledg of his being ſo nigh pleaſed them. <hi>Victoria,</hi> who
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60933:106"/>ſtill loved him, for all his prevarication, was hugely afflicted. <hi>Don Antonio</hi> ſent a Litter to convey <hi>Fernand</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> where being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, whil'ſt they were providing Cloaths for him and his Retinue, which was very magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent (he being the eldeſt Son of the Family and wealthy enough) the Chyrurgions of <hi>Madrid,</hi> more skilful then he at <hi>Illeſcas,</hi> cured him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well. <hi>Don Pedro de Silva,</hi> and <hi>Elvira</hi> his Daughter, had notice given them of the day whereon <hi>Don Antonio de Ribera</hi> had engaged to bring his Couſin <hi>Don Fernand</hi> to them. It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable the young <hi>Elvira</hi> had not neglected her ſelf, nor was <hi>Victoria</hi> a little concerned. She ſaw her faithleſs Lover make his entrance, trickt up like a Bridegroom, and if he was ſo taking in his tattered habit, what muſt he not be now he was ſo compleat. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was very well ſatisfied, and his Daughter muſt have been very nice, had ſhe not been fully pleaſed. The Servants of the houſe ſtared upon their young Ladies ſweet heart with open eyes, and every one of the Family were overjoy'd, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting poor <hi>Victoria,</hi> whoſe heart was heavy and almoſt overcharg'd with grief. <hi>Don Fernand</hi> was charmed with <hi>Elviras</hi> beauty; confeſſing, as his Couſin informed him, that the Painter had much injured her. His firſt complements ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a great deal of wit, and were not made up of thoſe extravagant fooleries, moſt men are guilty of, in their firſt addreſſes to a Father in Law, and a handſome Miſtreſs. <hi>Don Pedro de Silva</hi> Lock't himſelf up in a Cloſſet with the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60933:107"/>two Kinſmen and a Lawyer, to adjuſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that had been left unfiniſhed in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. In the mean time <hi>Elvira</hi> ſtaid in her own apartment, ſurrounded with her Women, who were entertaining his with the applauſe of her new Servitor: Onely <hi>Victoria</hi> ſtood cold and mute, whilſt they ſung her Encomiums; <hi>Elvira</hi> obſerved it, and took her aſide to tell her, ſhe admired that ſhe ſaid nothing of the happy choice her Father had made of a husband, who ſeemed ſo deſerving, and ſubjoyned, that either out of complaiſance or civility, ſhe ought to expreſs ſomewhat. Madam, replied <hi>Victoria,</hi> your Lovers preſence ſpeaks his worth ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it were needleſs to add my dull judgement to it. The coldneſs you have taken notice of does not proceed from any indifferency, I were unworthy of the favours you have vouchſafed me, ſhould I not ſhare in all that does concern you: And therefore be confident I ſhould be no leſs tranſported with joy at your Marriage, then all the reſt about you are, were I not ſo well acquainted with the Gentleman you are to Wedd. My own husband was an inhabitant of <hi>Sevil,</hi> whoſe houſe ſtood but a very little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from your Servants. He is indeed of a good Family, Rich, Handſome, and I do believe a man of Wit and other Excelling qualities. In fine, he is worthy of a Lady ſuch as you are: But withal, I am certain you deſerve a mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire affection, which he cannot beſtow on you, becauſe his heart is divided. I could wave this diſcovery, which may perhaps diſpleaſe you:

In this poſture were his affairs; purſued ſhe, when I came from thence, at which time it was alſo reported that <hi>Don Fernand</hi> was going to <hi>Madrid</hi> to be married. <hi>Elvira</hi> could not refrain asking, whether the aforeſaid <hi>Lucretia</hi> were a beauty? <hi>Victoria</hi> told her, ſhe wanted nothing but wealth, and ſo left her extreme penſive, and firmly reſolved to give her Father a preſent account of the buſineſs. At the ſame inſtant word was brought her that her deſigned husband waited without for her,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60933:108"/>having concluded the Article that they were conſulting on in the old Fathers Cloſſet: <hi>Elvira</hi> went to him, whilſt <hi>Victoria</hi> ſtaid in the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing Room, where the ſame fellow came to her that attended on him, when ſhe ſo Nobly releeved them after their being ſtript. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Servant of his, brought a Packet of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for his Maſter, which he had taken up at the Poſt-houſe. He did not know <hi>Elvira,</hi> ſo much her change of habit had diſguiſed her; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deſired to be admitted to the ſpeech of his Maſter, to deliver the ſaid Packet; She told him, it would be a good while before he could have that oppertunity with convenience, but if he durſt truſt her with his Letters, ſhe would be ſure to give them, as ſoon as poſſibly ſhe could get to him. The fellow made no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the caſe, but having left them in her cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he went about his affairs. <hi>Victoria</hi> who was reſolved to leave no ſtone unturned, goes up to her own Chamber, opens the Packet, and in a moment Seals it up again, together with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of her own contriving amongſt the reſt.

She intreated <hi>Don Diego</hi> to conceal himſelf in an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cove,</hi> aſſuring him it would be much for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to over-hear the diſcourſe ſhe ſhould have with <hi>Don Pedro.</hi> He did as ſhe injoyned him without more ado, more upon the account of her Beauty and brave meen, then any other expectation, and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was admitted into <hi>Victorias</hi> Chamber, not knowing her, ſo much had theſe Adornments and fine Feathers chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Bird that fed at his own Table: She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to place himſelf in a Chair, whence <hi>Don Diego</hi> could eaſily over-hear all they ſpake, and then began in theſe terms. I think Sir, it will be moſt proper in the firſt place, to let you know who I am, to prevent thoſe doubts that otherwiſe my Narration might raiſe in you. I am one of the Family of the <hi>Portocarrero's,</hi> born in the City of <hi>Toledo,</hi> where I was married at the Age of Thirteen, and became a Widow about ſix moneths after; my Father was of the Order of Saint <hi>James's</hi> Croſs, and my Brother is a Knight of the Order of <hi>Calatrava. Don Pedro</hi> interrupted her, to let her know her Father was of his acquaintance, and a moſt intimate Friend. It rejoyces me extreamly, Sir, ſaid ſhe, to know this from your mouth, for I ſhall ſtand in need of many Friends to help me in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition, as I ſhall inform you. After this ſhe gave an account to <hi>Don Pedro</hi> of all that

I thought it would be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming act, Sir, to make known my pretences to you, that you might put a ſtop o the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Match you had deſign'd: Your Daughter is too worthy to be caſt away upon ſuch a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Match, and I believe you are ſo diſcreet, you will not rob me to beſtow one upon her muſt prove her ruine, and be ſubject to that Divorce my 'Title will call for; were he a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> replied <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> I would have nothing to do with him, if he were unjuſt and falſe: I ſhall therefore not only deny him my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but my Houſe; and as for your ſelf Madam, both my Friends and Credit ſhall be ready to aſſiſt you when ever you deſire it: I had notice given me before, that he was a man would ſlip no opportunity of taking his pleaſure, even to the hazard of his Reputation, and being of that vain humour, though you had no concern for him, he never ſhould have my Daughter, whom Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven I hope will provide for in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> where ſhe may make a better choice. <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi> parted from <hi>Victoria</hi> having no more to ſay, and then ſhe called <hi>Don Diego</hi> out of the <hi>Alcove,</hi>

               <p>Well, ſaid <hi>Cave,</hi> what think you now of your friend, and your Brothers man, of that Girle that I had bred with ſo much care, and that young fellow whoſe quick wit and ripe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we ſo often admired. But my greateſt wonder, is that they were never obſerved to ſpeak to one another; nor did I ever find her inclined in the leaſt to ſuch a fooliſh love, and paſſion: and yet we find it ſo, my deareſt <hi>Star,</hi> and ſhe hath ſhewed her ſelf ſo deſperately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted, that it declares as much of madneſs, as of affection. I found her this day writing to her <hi>Leander</hi> in ſuch paſſionate expreſſions, that if I had not ſurprized her my ſelf, the world could not have perſwaded me it was ſo. You never heard her ſpeak ſuch Language yet; ah, had I not torn her Letters in my fury, you would be convinced, that at ſixteen years old, ſhe knows as much as thoſe that have made love their ſtudy double her Age. I carried her aſide into that Grove, whence ſhe was taken from me, to chide her for the trouble and ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſhe returned me, for all the pains and toil I have endured for her ſake: I will relate my ſufferings to you, and then judge you,

I ſay, every thing in nature ſlept, or ought to have been ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſome pitiful Poets excepted, whoſe brains were broken with hard Rhimes; ſome damn'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60933:120"/>unfortunate Lovers, and other rational or irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal animals that had that night ſomewhat elſe to do. It were unneceſſary to tell you that <hi>Deſtiny</hi> was one of thoſe that did not ſleep, no more then Madam <hi>Angelica's</hi> Raviſhers, whom he purſued as faſt as his Horſe could gallop, from whom the envious Clouds did often take away the feeble light of the Moon: He tenderly loved Madam <hi>Cave,</hi> becauſe ſhe was very lovely, and he was ſure to be loved agen, whoſe daughter was no leſs dear to him; beſides that, his Madam or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs <hi>Starr</hi> being neceſſitated to continue her act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Playes, could not amongſt all the troops of wandring Comedians, have met with two Actreſſes more vertuous then they were: I do not ſay but there are ſome of that Profeſſion that are ſuch; but in the opinion of moſt people, they are not ſo well ſtored with Vertue, as they are with Paint and old Embrodery; but perhaps ſuch are deceived, and wrong thoſe Virtuoſo's. Our generous Comedian rid therefore after thoſe Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhers with more haſte and animoſity, then the <hi>Lapithes</hi> after the <hi>Centaurs:</hi> He firſt rod down a long Lane, which led from the Garden door whence <hi>Angelica</hi> had been hurried; and having galloped ſome time, he run at randome into a deep way, as moſt of thoſe in the Country of <hi>Mayne</hi> are. This Rode was full of holes and ſtones, and though it was Moonlight, yet was it ſo dusk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, that <hi>Deſtiny</hi> could make his Horſe go no faſter then a Trot: He curſed the bad way in his heart, whilſt at the ſame inſtant he felt either a Man or a Devil leap up behind him on his Horſes Crupper,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60933:120"/>who threw his arms about his neck. <hi>Deſtiny</hi> was much affrighted, and his Horſe ſo ſtartled, that he had thrown him off, had not the Fantome, who hugged and embraced him, kept him ſecure in his Saddle: His Horſe poſted away as ſcared horſes uſe to do, and <hi>Deſtiny</hi> put him on with his Spurrs, not minding what he did, being very little pleaſed to feel two naked arms about his neck, and a cold Noſe ſnuffling behind his ear, and keeping ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act time with his horſes gallop. The Race was long, becauſe the way was not ſhort, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil drove: But in fine at the entrance into a Plain, the Horſe moderated his pace, and <hi>Deſtiny</hi> his fear; <hi>For by degrees we at length learn to endure the greateſt troubles.</hi> The Moon then afforded light enough to let him ſee that he had a great naked ugly Villain behind him, gaping and ſtaring upon him: He never asked him who he was, (I cannot tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were out of diſcretion) but he made his Horſe continue on his Gallop, though he were very much out of breath; and when he leaſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for it, the unwelcome Crupper-rider threw himſelf down, and there lay laughing. <hi>Deſtiny</hi> put his Horſe forwards with ſpeed, and turning his head back, he beheld his Fantome running with great ſwiftneſs towards the place from whence he rod; he hath ſince confeſſed, that one cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be more affrighted then he was: about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paces thence he found a great Road that led him to a Hamlet, where he heard all the Doggs in an uproar, which made him gueſs that thoſe he purſued might have paſſed that way, and given the alarm to thoſe faithful guardians: To inform
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60933:121"/>himſelf therein, he did what he could to awaken the inhabitants that were ſleeping in three or four houſes that ſtood next the high-way; but he could get no audience, and was onely grumbled at by their Doggs: yet having at length heard the cries of children in the laſt houſe, he made them open the door with his threatnings, and was informed by a woman in her Smock, who could not ſpeak without trembling, That ſome Souldiers had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed throw the Village but lately, and carried a woman along with them, who cried out very fiercely, ſo that they had much ado with her: he told the woman his rencontre of the naked man, and ſhe replyed, that he was a fellow of their Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, who having loſt his little wits, ran about the Country to find them. The information this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had given him of thoſe Souldiers that had paſſed the ſame way, encouraged him to go on, and made him ſpur his beaſt with more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. I ſhall not tell you how often he ſtumbled, and was afraid of his own ſhaddow; it ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to let you know that he loſt his way in a Wood, and that ſometimes having no light at all and at beſt, but a very little glimmering of the Moon; at the laſt he found it break of day juſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>WHilſt <hi>Destiny</hi> was thus running at random after thoſe that had ſtoln away <hi>Angelica; Rancour,</hi> and <hi>Olive,</hi> who did not take that misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſo much to heart, did not make ſo much haſt as the former after thoſe Raviſhers; and beſides, they were on foot. They went not far, before they met in the next Village with a good Inn that was not yet ſhut up, where they deſired a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The people led them into a Chamber, where was already in bed another either noble or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Traveller, who had ſupped, and being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to make all poſſible ſpeed, about ſome bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs that is unknown to me, intended to be gone very early the next morning. The arrival of theſe Comedians did not contribute much to his deſign of being early on horſe-back; for he was waked by them, and perhaps curſed them for it in his thoughts; but the preſence of two ſuch gentile blades did perhaps hinder him from expreſſing it to them. <hi>Rancour,</hi> who was of an acoſting car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, did preſently make ſome excuſe for their having interrupted his reſt, and withall asked of him, whence he came? He told him he was come from <hi>Anjou,</hi> and going into <hi>Normandy,</hi> for a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs that required haſt. <hi>Rancour</hi> diſ-robing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

At ſupper time they brought us a very handſome Treat into our Chamber; the Chyrurgion they had ſent for came; my Mothers Arm was dreſt, and ſhe put to bed, in a very high Feaver.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60933:129"/>believed that he was enamoured with my Mother; but he ſpake little to her, and rarely came into our Chamber, where we confined our ſelves after my Fathers Death. It is true indeed he often ſent to inquire of her health, yet this was how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ill ſpoken of in the Country, which we were afterwards informed of: But my Mother think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe could not handſomely make any longer ſtay in the Caſtle with a perſon of his condition, had already deſigned to leave it, intending to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to <hi>Marſeilles</hi> to her Fathers: She therefore informed the Baron of her retreat, returned him innumerable thanks for all the favours ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and implored him to add to all his former Obligations, this laſt, which was to furniſh her with ſome Horſes and other conveyance to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport her ſelf and Goods, to the next City, where ſhe intended to ſell what was leaſt neceſſary, and therewith be furniſhed to proſecute her journey.

The Curate was a long time converſing with my Mother, and went not from her till Supper time: I found her very thoughtful, and asked her twice or thrice what

My Mother ſuffered me to ſay what I pleaſed, but went to bed very much diſturbed, and was not at quiet all the night, nor took the leaſt repoſe. I would have baniſhed ſleep from my own eyes too, but it was ſo powerful I was forced to yield, and ſo had as much reſt as ſhe wanted. She roſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and when I waked, I found her dreſſed, and better compoſed in her looks and actions. I was willing to know what reſolution ſhe had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; for to tell you the truth, I flattered my imagination with the future greatneſs, which I hoped to ſee my Mother attain to, if the Baron of <hi>Sigognac</hi> meant as he promiſed, and could alure her to conſent to what he deſired. The very thought of hearing my Mother called Madam, or the Barons Lady, pleaſingly took up my mind, and that ambition did by little and little ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60933:131"/>my heart. Mrs. <hi>Cave,</hi> was thus relating her ſtory, and Madam <hi>Star</hi> giving attentive ear to it, when they heard ſomething walking in their Chamber, which ſeemed the more ſtrange to them, becauſe they remembred they had locked and bolted the door, mean while they ſtill heard ſomething ſtalk up and down: They asked who was there, but were not anſwered, and a moment after, <hi>Cave</hi> ſaw the reſemblance of ſome body, heard it ſigh, and felt it preſs ſomewhat rudely upon her feet: She raiſed her ſelf half way up in her bed to look nearer what it might be that thus begun to affright her, and reſolving to ſpeak, put her head out of the bed, but then nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared: The leaſt Company gives us ſometimes confidence; but ſometimes again our fears are not diminiſhed when divided: <hi>Cave</hi> was frighted becauſe the object vaniſhed, and <hi>Star</hi> was no leſs affrighted becauſe her Bed-fellow was ſo. They ſunk down into the Bed, hiding their heads under the Cloaths, and creeping cloſe to each other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo heartily affraid, that they durſt not ſpeak a word to each other. In fine, <hi>Cave</hi> ſaid to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Star,</hi> that her dear Daughter was dead, and this was her Ghoſt which came to bemoan it ſelf by her. Madam <hi>Star</hi> was, perhaps, about to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer her, when they heard the ſame ſtamping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain about the Room, Madam <hi>Star</hi> crept lower yet into the Bed then ſhe was before, and <hi>Cave</hi> having re-aſſumed ſome confidence upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that it was her Daughters, ſat her ſelf upright in the Bed, as before, and perceiving the ſame ſhape which before had appeared and ſighed ſo
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60933:131"/>ſadly at her Feet, ſhe reached forth her hand and felt ſomething very hairy, which made her ſhreek out moſt hideouſly, and tumble down backwards upon her pillow: At the inſtant they heard a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible barking in the Chamber, juſt as when a Dog is ſcared in the night with what he ſees. <hi>Cave</hi> had now recovered her courage again, and looking earneſtly at what it might be, plainly ſound it was a large Greyhound that barked at the out cry ſhe made. She ſpoke to him in a threatning tone and Dialect, which made him run towards a corner of the Chamber where he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. The valiant Comedian leap'd out of her bed, and by the light of the Moon which darted through the Window, ſhe diſcovered in that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Chamber where the Fantoſm Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound diſappeared, a little Trap-door that came up the back way, concealed behind the Hangings, He had ſome deſire to have lodged upon the bed, for they ſoon gueſſed it to be one of the Houſe-dogs that had ſtoln up by thoſe private Stairs, and not daring to preſume ſo far without their free conſent, ſighed Dog-like, and made the beſt ſigns could be expected from a dumb creature by laying his fore-leggs upon the feet of the bed, &amp; creeping under it, when <hi>Cave</hi> looked at him the firſt time. This could not at the very firſt take off the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of its being her poor Daughters Ghoſt in <hi>Stars</hi> opinion, who not having ſeen the Hound, could not eaſily be perſwaded it was ſuch: which though her affliction were great, yet afforded her ſome matter to rally at <hi>Stars</hi> Cowardize, and gave a pauſe to her Hiſtory, till ſome fitter time, when

               <p>I Am a Gentleman of a Family not a little known in the Province: I hope one day to have at leaſt twelve thouſand Livers <hi>per annum,</hi> provided my good Father would but die, who although he be above fourſcore years of age, makes all thoſe diſpair whoſe Fortune depends on his abſence out of this world, or have any thing to do with him, becauſe he is ſo healthy, that I do more fear he will never die, then hope to ſucceed him in three very handſome Farms, which are all his income. He would needs have me to be a Counſellor in the Parliament of <hi>Bretaigne,</hi> againſt my inclination; &amp; to this end he put me very early to my Studies. I was a Schollar at <hi>la Fleſche,</hi> when your Company came to Act. I ſaw Madam <hi>Angelica,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo in Love with her, that I had not the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do any thing elſe but what tended to expreſs
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60933:134"/>that love: I did more yet, for I had the confidence to tell her that I loved her, ſhe was not offended with it; I wrote to her, ſhe received my Letter, and did not ſhew any tokens of diſdain: After that, Madam <hi>Cave</hi> being obliged to keep her Chamber whilſt ſhe was ſick at <hi>la Fleſche,</hi> gave me the happy opportunity of frequently converſing with her Daughter: She would no doubt have obſtructed our communications, being too ſevere for one of her profeſſion, which ſeems to diſpence with thoſe that undertake it from that ſcruple and reſervedneſs which ſhe practiſes. After I was enamoured with her Daughter I forſook the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and never miſſed one day to ſee them Act. The Father Jeſuits would have reduced me to my devoir; but I could not be brought to ſubmit to thoſe crabbed Maſters, after I had choſen the moſt charning Miſtriſs in the world; your Servant was killed at the Play-houſe door by ſome of our brutiſh Scholars, who all that year committed many inſolencies at <hi>la Fleſche,</hi> being very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and the Wine very cheap: That was the occaſion partly that you quitted <hi>la Fleſche</hi> to go to <hi>Angiers.</hi> I could not take my farewell of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Angelica,</hi> becauſe her Mother was never out of her eye; all I could do, was to appear before her, when ſhe went, with the Characters of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair on my face, and tears in my eyes; a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate look which ſhe darted on me, had like to have coſt me my life. I bolted my ſelf up in my Chamber, and wept the remaining portion of that day, and all the ſucceeding night; and as ſoon as the Sun aroſe, changing my habit for that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60933:134"/>of my mans, which fitted me exactly, I left him at <hi>la Fleſche</hi> to ſell my Schollars equipage, and gave him a Letter for one of my Fathers Tenants, who furniſhes me with money when I demand it, with command to come to me at <hi>Angiers;</hi> ſo I follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after you, and overtook you at <hi>Duretail,</hi> where many perſons of Quality that hunted the Stagg ſtopped you for ſeven or eight dayes. I proffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you my ſervice, and you took me to wait on you, whether it were that you found the want of him that was murthered, or that my Garb and Looks which did not diſpleaſe you, invited you to accept it: My hair, which I had cauſed to be cut very ſhort, diſguiſed me from the knowledge of thoſe that had often ſeen me diſcourſe with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Angelica:</hi> to which my mans mean apparel contributed much, making me appear quite other then I was in my own habit, which was moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly above the common wear of Schollars: I was at firſt however diſcovered and known to Madam <hi>Angelica,</hi> who ſince acknowledged that ſhe doubted not but my affection was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, ſince I forſook all other intereſts to wait on her; ſhe was ſo generous as to diſſwade me, and to bid me endeavour to retrive my reaſon, which ſhe found ſtraggling; ſhe entertained me a long while with ſo much coyneſs, as would have diſheartned any man leſs amorous then my ſelf. But, in fine with ſo much loving her, I engaged her to return me as much love again, as I had for her; and as your ſoul is above the common ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, ſo you eaſily perceived, that mine was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove my low condition. I obtained your favour,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60933:135"/>and ſoon got the good will of all the Gentlemen of your company; nor was I hated by <hi>Rancour,</hi> who is thought by moſt to love no body, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hate all the world. I will not trouble you with the tedious repetition of ſuch things as uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally paſs betwixt young perſons who love one another, at every review or freſh converſation; ſince I doubt not but you are well read in thoſe things your ſelf. I ſhall only tell you, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Cave,</hi> miſtruſting our private intelligence, or rather not miſtruſting, but certainly knowing it, forbid her Daughter to diſcourſe at all with me, which ſhe could not obey, but having ſurprized her writing to me, ſhe treated her ſo ſeverely both in publick and private, that I had afterwards no great difficulty to diſpoſe her to let me ſteal her away. I ſhall not be afraid to confeſs it to you, knowing you to be as generous as any man whatever, and as amorous at leaſt as my ſelf. <hi>Deſtiny</hi> bluſhed at <hi>Leanders</hi> laſt words, who went on in this manner, and told <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> That he had not left the Company but to put himſelf into a poſture to execute his deſign; That a Farmer had promiſed to ſupply him with money, and that he hoped to receive ſome more of a Merchants Son of St. <hi>Malo's,</hi> whoſe Friendſhip he was aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of, and who by the death of his Parents was lately become Maſter of a good Eſtate; he added, That by his friends means, he hoped to paſs ſafely over into <hi>England,</hi> and when he was there to make his peace with his Father, without expoſing Madam <hi>Angelica</hi> to the old mans anger, who without doubt would have made uſe of all the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60933:135"/>a rich man hath the power to levy againſt a pair of Actors. <hi>Deſtiny</hi> made <hi>Leander</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that by reaſon of his youth, and his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his Father could not but have accuſed Madam <hi>Cave</hi> of a Trapan. But he did not aſſay to make him take off, or extinguiſh his affection, knowing experimentally that Lovers are not capable of any counſel but what their own paſſion ſuggeſts, but are more to be pitied, then directed: But he highly diſapproved the intention he had to go o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into <hi>England,</hi> and repreſented to him what judgment would be made of two young perſons together in a ſtrange Country; together with the troubles and hazards of a Voyage by Sea, the difficulty of drawing our money if they ſhould find themſelves in want; and, in fine, the enterprize that Madam <hi>Angelica's</hi> beauty might put Forraigners upon, and many other like incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies ariſing thereby. <hi>Leander</hi> would not plead an ill cauſe, but once more craved pardon of <hi>Deſtiny</hi> for having ſtood ſo long in the dark near him; and <hi>Deſtiny</hi> promiſed him all the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance poſſible, and aſſured him he would make the beſt uſe he could of the power he thought he had with Madam <hi>Cave,</hi> to make her comply and become favourable. He told him moreover, that if he were abſolutely reſolved never to have any other but Madam <hi>Angelica,</hi> he were better not forſake the Company; for, ſaid he, in ſome time your Father may poſſibly die, or your paſſion may abate, and perhaps vaniſh; at which words <hi>Leander</hi> cryed out, that could never happen: Well then, ſaid <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> for fear of the like on
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60933:136"/>your Miſtreſſes part, keep ſtill in ſight and play<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Act with us, ſince it is now done very frequently by ſuch as might poſſibly undertake to do better things; write to your Father, making him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you are in the Army, and indeavour to ſqueeze a good ſumme of money out of him: In the mean while we will dwell together like Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and I ſhall ſtrive by my future deportment to make a fair amends for the mean treatment you may have hitherto received at my hands, whilſt I looked upon you as a menial Servant only, not a diſguiſed Lover and Gentleman: <hi>Leander</hi> would have caſt himſelf down at his feet, had not his wounds which diſorder'd him very much tied him to his bed, but he made up the want of that by ſo many expreſſions of his civility and Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and made likewiſe ſo many hearty vows of an unalterable and ready Friendſhip, that he from that time gained as great an eſteem from <hi>Deſtiny</hi> as it was poſſible to beget in any man, after which they conſulted of ſeeking out Madam <hi>Angelica;</hi> but a great noiſe ſuddenly coming to their ears did interrupt their converſation, and called <hi>Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> haſtily down into the Kitchin, where ſomewhat happened, as is related in the following Chapter.</p>

                  <p>A Cuffing Combat. The death of mine Hoſt, and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable things.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TWO men, one clad in Black like a Maſter of a Village, the other in Gray, who had the Meen of a Baily, held one another by the Locks and Beards, and now and then boxing each other in a moſt cruel manner: Both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were what their habits or out-ſides ſpoke them to be. The fellow in Black was the Curates Brother, and the Gray-coat was a Baily of the place, and Brother to mine Hoſt. The Hoſt was then in a Chamber next the Kitchin ready to give up the Ghoſt, having been ſo violently ceazed on by a Fever, that it had made him almoſt diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, inſomuch as he had well-nigh beaten out his brains againſt a wall, and his broken pate, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Fever, had brought him ſo low, that when his frenzy quitted him, he found himſelf conſtrained to loſe his life too; which he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps leſs grieved at, then he was to leave his ill-gotten wealth: He had born arms a long while, and at laſt returning home to his Birth place,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60933:137"/>crazed with wounds, age and little honeſty, of which he brought leſs home then of wealth, though he were poor: But, as Women are moſt times taken with that which ſhould leaſt of all tempt them, his greaſie Perriwig, which had more buſh then the reſt of the crop-eared Villages, his Camp Oaths, flaunting Feather, which he wore on fine days, and an old long ruſty Rapier that clattered at his Breech and armed heels, for ſpurs were the ordinary mode in thoſe days, though they had neither money nor credit to get horſes; all this parade appeared gentile and charming in the eyes of an old Hoſteſs Widow that was Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of the Inn: She had been woed by the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Farmers in that Country, not ſo much for her Beauty, as the Wealth ſhe had ſcraped up in her former Husbands time, by long Bills, and ſhort or ſcant meaſure; both in Wine, Beer, and Oats: But ſhe had ſtill withſtood all theſe pretenders. When this old Souldier joyning the Battailloons of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Cupid</hi> in a body, aſſaulted her, and became Victor. The Viſage of this Tavern Nimph was the leaſt, and her belly the biggeſt, of all the Womens in the Country of <hi>Mayne,</hi> although that Country does abound in large wembs; I leave it to the Naturaliſts to find the reaſon of this, as well as of the fatneſs of the Capons that are bred there: And to come to our little great Woman, whom methinks I ſee every time I do but think on her, ſhe married her Souldier, without any advice or knowledge of her kindred, and after ſhe had a long time watched with him, and ſuffered very much, ſhe had the pleaſure of ſeeing him die with
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60933:137"/>a crackt Scull, which ſhe attributed to a juſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe he had often: indeavoured to break hers. When <hi>Deſtiny</hi> entred into the Kitchin, this woman and her Maid were aſſiſting the old Curate the Pariſh to part the Fray; But that was not ſo eaſily done, and therefore he put in his helping hand, and having firſt made them ſtand a little, though he could not ſo ſoon part them, as being grapled together like two men of War at Sea, be by his terrible threats made them, as I ſaid, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend a while their fury, which they ſubmitted to out of reſpect to him who ſpake very magiſterial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though they had little minded their good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors exhortations; ſo the two mortal enemies at length ſeparated, ſpitting out a great deal of blood, and no ſmall quantity of their teeth, whilſt their Noſes were beſmeared with their gore, and their chins and pates bald and disfigured. The Curate was an honeſt man, and knew the world a little; He civilly thanked <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> and <hi>Deſtiny</hi> to pleaſe and ſatisfie him, made thoſe Combatants embrace one another in Friendſhip, who but a moment before were doing ſo to ſtrangle each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: During this accommodation, the Hoſt end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his obſcure fate, without advertiſing his friends: So that they found there remained no more to do, but only to interre him, when they afterwards went into his Chamber, after the peace had been concluded. The Curate made his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the dead, and made them ſweet for they were ſhort; His Vicar came to aſſiſt him, and mean time the Widow began to howl and lament with much oſtentation and vanity. The dead
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60933:138"/>mans Brother either diſſembled a great ſadneſs, or was really ſo, nor were the ſerving-men and maids behind him in their mournings and ſorrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Curate followed <hi>Deſtiny</hi> to his Chamber, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him proffers of ſervice: He did the like to <hi>Leander,</hi> and they made him ſit down and eat with them. <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> who had ſcarce eaten any thing that day, and had uſed exerciſe enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him an eager Appetite, fell to it very fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Leander</hi> fed himſelf with amorous thoughts more then with the proviſions on the Board; and the Curate talked more then he eat: He related a hundred pleaſant Stories of the dead mans Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and told them the extravagant quarrels that predominant paſſion had begot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him, and his Wife and Neighbours; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others he deſcribed a journey which he had made with his Wife to <hi>Laval;</hi> at their return, the Horſe which carried them both, having loſt his fore-ſhoes, he left his Wife ſtanding under a tree, and holding the Horſe by the bridle, till he went back to the place and had ſought moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently for the ſhoes all along the rode they had travelled: but he loſt his labour, whilſt his Wife had almoſt loſt her patience in waiting ſo long for him, he having walked at leaſt four miles back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and forward, which made her almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of his return, till at length ſhe perceived him trotting towards her bare-footed, having ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Boots and Stockings croſs his ſhoulders: She was much amazed at this novelty; but durſt not inquire the reaſon of it, his long obedience in the Army abroad, had taught him ſo well to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60933:138"/>at home; neither durſt ſhe mutter at him, when he made her pull off her own ſhoes and and ſtockings, nor ſo much as ask him what his fancy therein was; but only ſhe imagined it might be ſomewhat of Devotion or pennance: So ſhe took the Horſe by the bridle, and he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing behind cudgelled him forward, and thus all three, beat it on the bare hoof till they got home, which was not without infinite trouble to them all, it being paſt midnight e're they arrived, being ſo foundred and battered, that they were not able in a whole fortnight afterwards to ſtand upon their galled feet: Never was he ſo well pleaſed with any former ſtratagem as with this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and every time it came into his memory, he would ſmile at the thrifty device, and ſay, Wife, had we not unſhoed our ſelves when we came from <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> there had been two pair of ſhoes the more ſquandred away, beſides the Horſe-ſhoes, and our ſtockings to boot. <hi>Deſtiny</hi> and <hi>Leander</hi> were not much moved to laughter at this tale, which the Curate thought to be very taking; whether, it were not ſo pleaſant in their opinions as in his, or they out of humour then, I know not: But the Curate, who was a perpetual talker, would not give over thus; but addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Deſteny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> he told him, That what he had juſt before rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was nothing to what he had yet to entertain him with, about the ſame perſons preparing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for death. It is at leaſt four or five days ſince that he knew he muſt march off; yet never did he concern himſelf more for the expences of his Family, grudging at every new laid Egg they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60933:139"/>dreſſed for himſelf during his malady; He would needs caſt up the account of the charges of his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and made a bargain with me as ſoon as ever I came to confeſs him: and in fine, to end as he began, about two hours before his laſt gaſp, he ordained his Wife to wrap his body in no other ſhrowd then an old rag that had above a hundred tatters and holes in it: His Wife told him it would be too beggarly, but he was obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to have no better; She could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly condiſcend, and knowing he was now not in a condition to beat her, ſhe ſpoke more reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then ſhe yet had ever done to him, but yet did not forfeit the reſpect due to a Husband from a Wife: Wherefore ſhe proceeded to ask him with what confidence he could think to appear thus in the Valley of <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> in that pitiful trim, when the time of the reſurrection ſhould come to paſs. The ſick man, began to be in wrath, and ſwearing as he was wont to do in his time of health: <hi>S'death,</hi> cried he, <hi>you ſlut, I will not appear at the Reſurrection.</hi> I could as hardly forbear laughing, as I could make him comprehend that he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God, both by his being ſo angry at that ſeaſon, and by the anſwer he gave to his Wife, which had ſomewhat of impiety in it. He made ſome kind of ſhew of contrition, but we were fain to promiſe him that he ſhould be wrapped in no other ſhrowd then what he contended for: My Brother who brake forth into a laughter when he thus peremptorily renounced his Reſurrection, could not contain himſelf afterwards every time he did but think on it. The dying mans Brother
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60933:139"/>took an offence at it, and from words to words, my Brother and he being both alike brutiſh, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to blows, and had laid good hold upon each other, after many repeated cuffs, and would perhaps have continued their uncivil war till now, had they not been timely parted. Thus did the Curate put a period to his relation, addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> becauſe he perceived <hi>Leander</hi> lent him but little attention. He took his leave of the Comedians, after he had again proffered them his ſervice, and <hi>Deſtiny</hi> endeavoured to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort afflicted <hi>Leander,</hi> giving him the beſt hopes his thoughts could prompt him withall. And as much wounded as he was, the poor youth, from time to time gazed out of the Window to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his man were coming, as if that could have made him haſten his ſteps. Thus when we impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently expect the return of ſome important meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, the wiſeſt are then fooliſh enough to caſt their looks often that way they are to come; and with this obſervation I ſhall put an end to my ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>LEander</hi> thus looked out of the Chamber Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, towards the way his Servant was to come by, when turning his head accidentally, the other way, he perceived the little <hi>Ragotin,</hi> Boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to the twiſt, mounted upon a ſmall Mule, and having at either ſide of him, his two Pages, <hi>Rancour</hi> upon one hand, and <hi>Olive</hi> on the other. They had from Village to Village heard News of <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> and by a diligent and long March, had, infine, overtaken him at the fore mentioned place, <hi>Deſtiny</hi> went down Stairs to meet them, and made them come up into their Room: They did not at the firſt view know the young <hi>Leander,</hi> who had changed his Meen with his habit; and that they
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60933:140"/>might not find out what he really was, <hi>Deſtiny</hi> commanded him to go and cauſe Supper to be made ready, with the ſame Authority he was wont to uſe; and the Comedians who thereby recovered their former knowledge of him, had no ſooner ſaid to him that he was very Gallant, but <hi>Deſtiny</hi> anſwered for him, and told them, that a rich Uncle of his in the Country of <hi>Maine,</hi> had cloathed him <hi>Cap a Pe,</hi> as they ſaw, and withall, had furniſhed him with money to oblige him to leave acting, which he would not be drawn to, and therefore had ſecretly left him, without his knowledge. <hi>Deſtiny</hi> and the others, then inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of each other the News of what they were in queſt of, but could anſwer little. <hi>Ragotin</hi> aſſured <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> that he had left the Women in good health, though much afflicted for the loſs of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Angelica.</hi> The night came on, they ſupped, and theſe new comers drank as freely, as the others had done ſparingly. <hi>Ragotin</hi> began to be in a good humour; defied every one to drink, like a Tavern Hector; plaid the Drole, and ſung his Song in deſpite of all the world; but not being ſeconded, and the deceaſed mans Brother in Law, having repreſented to the Company, how unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent it was to be thus frolick and debauched where a dead Corps was, <hi>Ragotin</hi> made leſs noiſe, and drank more Wine.

The Hoſteſs lay in an
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60933:141"/>upper Chamber next to <hi>Deſtiny's</hi> and <hi>Leanders</hi> lodging, which ſhe choſe becauſe ſhe would not have the ſad object of her departed Husband ſo much in her eye, and that ſhe might the better receive the Viſits of a great many Friends that came to comfort, and to condole with her; for ſhe was one of the greateſt Dames in the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, and had ever been as much beloved of them all; as her late Husband was hated. A ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſilence reigned in the whole Inn; the Dogs ſlept ſince they did not bark; and all other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals ſlept likewiſe, or at leaſt ought to have ſlept, and this tranquillity laſted yet till three or four of the Clock in the morning, when on a ſudden <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotin</hi> cryed out with all his might, that <hi>Rancour</hi> was dead; at the ſame inſtant he waked <hi>Olive;</hi> went to allarm <hi>Deſtiny</hi> and <hi>Leander,</hi> and made them come down into his Chamber to bemoan, or at leaſt behold, <hi>Rancour,</hi> who ſuddenly died in the bed juſt by him, as he would make them believe. <hi>Deſtiny</hi> and <hi>Leander</hi> followed him, and the firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject they met with coming into the room was <hi>Rancour,</hi> who was walking about the Chamber, like one that is very well, though that were very ſtrange after a ſudden death. <hi>Ragotin,</hi> who was the firſt that entred, had no ſooner eſpied him, but he retreated, as one that is ready to ſet his foot on a Serpent, or in a hole: He gave a great ſhreek, became as pale as death, and ruſhed ſo fiercely againſt <hi>Destiny</hi> and <hi>Leander,</hi> when he threw himſelf backwards out of the door, that he had almoſt thrown them down: whilſt his fear made him flie into the Garden, where he ventured
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60933:141"/>to ſtarve in the cold; <hi>Deſtiny</hi> and <hi>Leander</hi> demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>Rancour</hi> the particulars of his Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival. <hi>Rancour</hi> told them he knew not ſo much of it as <hi>Ragotin;</hi> and added, that he was not over wiſe: <hi>Olive</hi> in the mean while laughed like a fool; <hi>Rancour</hi> ſpake little and but coldly, as his cuſtom was, and neither he nor <hi>Olive</hi> would declare any thing further. <hi>Leander</hi> went after <hi>Ragotin,</hi> and found him hiding himſelf behind a buſh, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling more for fear then cold, though he were but in his ſhirt. His fancy was ſo poſſeſſed with his Companions death, that he at firſt took <hi>Leander</hi> for his ſpirit, and thought to flie when he drew near him: Thereupon <hi>Deſtiny</hi> arrived, whom he appehended to be another Fantome. They could not get the leaſt word from him, whatever they ſaid; ſo that, in fine, they took him by either arm to drag him to his bed: But at the ſame time that they were haling him out of the Garden door, <hi>Rancour</hi> being juſt coming in, <hi>Ragotin</hi> got looſe from them, and threw himſelf, looking ſtill behind him, into a hedge of Roſe-trees, where he intangled himſelf from head to foot, and could not break through ſoon enough to avoid <hi>Rancour,</hi> who ran after him, telling him he was a fool, and muſt be bound or chained: Theſe three at length pulled him out of the ſnare. <hi>Rancour</hi> gave him a good bang on his naked Breech, to evince him, that he was not a Ghoſt, and ſo in the concluſion the little fellow was led back to his Chamber and put to bed again: But he was ſcarce warm in the neſt, when a Feminine clamour aroſe in the Neighbouring room, which put them to a ſtand
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60933:142"/>to gueſs what it might be; it was not the moan of an afflicted Woman, but the horrid yellings of many Women together, as if they had been frighted. <hi>Deſtiny</hi> went thither, and found fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At the ſame inſtant a great Car ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ceized on a Pigeon, which the Maid had left half larded on the Dreſſer, and retiring with the prey into <hi>Ragotins</hi> Chamber, had hid it ſelf under the bed where he and <hi>Rancour</hi> had lain: The Maid purſued it with a Faggot ſtick in her hand, and looking under the bed to ſee what was become of the Pigeon, ſhe likewiſe cried out as loud as ſhe could poſſibly, that ſhe had found her Maſter, and repeated it ſo often, that at length the Hoſteſs and the whoſe crew of Women came thither to her. The Maid hung about her Miſtreſſes neck, telling her ſhe found him, with ſo much joy, that the poor Widow feared her Husband was come to life again; for it was obſerved that ſhe grew as pale as a condemned Priſoner. In fine, the Maid, bid
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60933:142"/>them look under the bed; where they found the dead Corps they were ſo troubled for; The trouble to get him thence, was not ſo great, though it were very heavy, as to know how it came there. They carried it back to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and began to ſhrowd it. The Comedians returned to their own; where <hi>Deſtiny</hi> lodged who could comprehend nothing of all this ſtrange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture; as for <hi>Leander</hi> nothing but his dear <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi> took up his thoughts, which made him as penſive, as <hi>Ragotin</hi> was ſorry that <hi>Rancour</hi> was not dead, whoſe biting Railleries had ſo mortified him, that he became ſilent, contrary to his nature, which was to ſpeak eternally, and to be the chief in all Companies and Diſcourſes, right or wrong. <hi>Rancour</hi> and <hi>Olive</hi> were ſo little ſurprized and moved at all this Panick terrour, and the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration of a dead Corps from one Chamber to another without any humane aſſiſtance, at leaſt any they knew of, that <hi>Deſtiny</hi> judged they had ſome hand in the Prodigy. Mean while the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs was canvaſed in the Kitchin; a Cart-driver being come out of the fields to Dinner, having heard the Maid relate with great aſtoniſhment, how her Maſters dead body, had riſen of it ſelf and walked in another room, told her, that paſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Kitchin-window at break of day, he ſaw two men in their ſhirts that carried it upon their ſhoulders into the Chamber where ſhe found it: The Brother hearing what this fellow affirmed, thought it very unhandſomely done; The Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow was quickly made acquainted with the ſtory, and her Goſſips too; and all of them were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60933:143"/>ſcandalized therewith, and concluded infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that thoſe men muſt needs be Sorcerers, and deſigned to act ſome hainous miſchief with that dead body: Juſt, as they were giving this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of <hi>Rancour,</hi> he entred into the Kitchin, and bid them bring his Breakfaſt to their Chamber. The defuncts Brother asked him, wherefore he had carried the Corps into his Chamber? <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour</hi> far from giving any reply, would not ſo much as beſtow a look on him: The Widow propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame queſtion, and he ſhewed the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference to her, though ſhe had not the like for him; She flew at his eyes like a Lioneſs robbed of her Whelps, (I am afraid the compariſon is too Magnificent here) Her Brother in-law lent <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour</hi> a ſound cuff on the ear; the Hoſteſſes ſhe Champions would not ſpare him neither; the Servants had their hands in too: But one mans body had not place enough for ſo many blows, and they did but injure and hinder each other. <hi>Rancour,</hi> alone againſt a great many, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence a great many againſt him ſingly, was not diſcouraged at the numbers of his enemies; but making a vertue of neceſſity, began to lay about with all the ſtrength God had given him, leaving the reſt to Fate. Never was unequal combat better managed; But <hi>Rancour</hi> keeping his judgment in the midſt of theſe perils, made uſe of his wiles as well as his ſtrength, dealing out his blows warily, that they might not light in vain: He gave ſome blows, that were not down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right to the firſt he met with, and only ſliding his hand along, as I may ſay, the ſame furious ſtroke
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60933:143"/>reached to a third, perhaps a fourth cheek; moſt of his ſtroaks walking round in a half circle; and theſe ſeveral ſtrokes had each two or three differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſounds, according as the chops they met with were more or leſs ſolid, or hollow. At the noiſe of theſe Combatants <hi>Olive</hi> deſcended into the Kitchin, and hardly had the time to find out his Companion amongſt thoſe that were baiting of him, ere he was ſet upon himſelf, and as hardly engaged as the other, whoſe vigorous reſiſtance began to quell and cool their courage: Two or three, therefore of thoſe that had been worſt dealt with by <hi>Rancour;</hi> fell upon <hi>Olive,</hi> perhaps to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain their dying credit; The noiſe encreaſed, and at the ſame time, the Hoſteſs received a great blow in her little eye; which made her ſee a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Candles (that is a certain; for an uncertain number) and put her quite out of the liſts: She roared louder, and far more heartily at this, then ſhe had done for her Husbands deceaſe. Her bellowings drew in more Neighbours, and ſummoned down <hi>Deſtiny</hi> and <hi>Leander;</hi> Though theſe came with a Spirit of peace, yet was there immediately a War denounced againſt them; They wanted not for blows, nor were they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to return them as ſtifly back again. The Hoſteſs, her Friends and Servants, cryed out Theeves, and were now become only Spectators of the Scuffle; ſome their eyes ſwelled, others with bloody Noſes, the reſt with battered muzles, and all unhooded and uncoyfed; The Neighbours took the Womens part againſt thoſe they termed Theeves.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60933:144"/>had gotten. But unhappy diſcord with her Snaky locks, had not yet done all in that houſe which ſhe intended to do: They heard an out cry above in the Chamber not much unlike that of a Hog that is ſtuck in the throate, and who ſhould it be but little <hi>Ragotin.</hi> The Curate, the Comedians, and ſeveral others ran up to him, and found all his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, only his ſmall head excepted, buried in a great Cheſt, wherein they uſed to lay their Sheets; and what was moſt unhappy for this poor entombed fellow, the lid of this Wooden Sepulchre, being very heavy, was fallen juſt upon his legs, and ſqueezed them ſo, that it was pitiful to behold. A luſty Servant Maid, who ſtood not far from him, when they came up, and who appeared very much diſordered, was ſuſpected to have thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapped and caſed <hi>Ragotin:</hi> It was ſo, and ſhe was proud of it, inſomuch that being buſied in making up one of the Beds in the Chamber, ſhe would not vouchſafe ſo much as to look how they pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſmall Jack, out of his box, nor give the leaſt reply to thoſe that asked her, whence that terrible noiſe proceeded which they had heard. Mean time, this little Epitomy of a man was haled out of his Mouſe-trap, and was no ſooner upon his legs and at liberty again, but he ran towards a Sword; They hindred him from ſeiſing on that, but could not keep him from flying at the great Wench, nor her from diſcharging ſuch a puiſſant blow upon his head, that the vaſt ſeat of his little reaſon was miſerably ſhaken out of order: He retreated three ſteps, but this going backward was only to return with the greater fury, if <hi>Olive</hi> had not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60933:145"/>withheld him by his Breeches; juſt as he was going to leap like a nimble Serpent againſt his potent enemy. The buſtle he made, though in vain, was very violent, the waſt-band of his Breeches broke, and that broke the ſilence of the Spectators, who all fell into a laughter; The very Curate forgot his Gravity, and the Brother-in law his ſorrow: only <hi>Ragotin</hi> bad no cauſe to be merry, whoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger now bent it ſelf againſt <hi>Olive,</hi> who finding himſelf attaqued, lifted him quite from the floor, and carried him by ſtrength of arm, to the bed which the Maid was juſt making, where with a <hi>Herculean</hi> ſtrength, he pulled down his already torn Breeches, and raiſing up, and then letting fall his hand very nimbly upon his back-parts, ſoon made them look all over as red as Scarlet: The undaunted <hi>Ragotin</hi> threw himſelf deſperately down from the bed; but this daring attempt had not its deſerved ſucceſs: He ſlipt his foot into a Chamber-pot, which they had left at the ſide next the wall to his trouble, and there it ſtuck ſo faſt, that notable to get it forth with the help of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foot, he durſt not come out of that corner for fear of making the Company laugh afreſh at his diſgrace, and begin again their Raillery, which he underſtood the worſt of any one in the world.

               <p>
                  <hi>RAncour</hi> and <hi>Ragotin</hi> lodged together, as for <hi>Olive,</hi> he waſted part of the night in ſowing his Cloaths which were ripped in divers places when he grappled with the Cholerick <hi>Ragotin.</hi> Thoſe that were acquainted with this little fellow particularly, have obſerved, that when ever he ſcuffled with any one, which was frequently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, he had always either unripped, or torn part or all his enemies Cloaths. That was his ſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, ſo that ſuch as were to deal with him at fiſty-cuffs, muſt have been as watchful to defend their Cloaths from his direful Claws, as others are wary to ſave their faces at Foils. <hi>Rancour</hi> asked him when he was going to bed whether he felt any hurt, becauſe his countenance looked very ill; <hi>Ragotin</hi> replied he never found himſelf better. It was not long ere they fell aſleep, and it hapned well for <hi>Ragotin,</hi> that <hi>Rancour</hi> bare ſome reſpect to the good Company that was then at the Inn, and would not diſturb their repoſe: had it not been for them, the ſmall <hi>Mounſieur</hi> had probably paſſed, but an unquiet Night. <hi>Olive</hi> the mean while was hard at work about his Cloaths, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60933:150"/>finiſhed all that was amiſs about them, he ſtole up <hi>Ragotins</hi> Cloaths, and as artificially as any Tailor could have contrived it, he cut both the Breeches and Doublet a great deal leſs in the waſte, and put them, after they were neatly ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the ſame place again, and having waſted the greateſt part of the Night in ripping, cutting and ſowing, crept into the ſame bed with <hi>Ragotin</hi> and <hi>Rancour.</hi> They roſe early, as people uſually do in ſuch Inns, where there is a perpetual noiſe as ſoon as day appears. <hi>Rancour</hi> told <hi>Ragotin,</hi> again, that he looked, very ill; <hi>Olive</hi> aſſured him ſo to: he began to believe them, and finding his Cloaths at the ſame time too ſtrait for him, by an Inch or two, he apprehended that his body was ſwollen to that proportion, and was affrighted at the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den accident. <hi>Rancour</hi> and <hi>Olive</hi> continued to exagerate his unhealthy Meen, and <hi>Deſtiny</hi> and <hi>Leander</hi> whom they had acquainted with the plot, did each of them tell him he was hugely changed. Poor <hi>Ragotin</hi> ſtood amazed with tears in his eyes, which made <hi>Deſtiny</hi> ſmile a little, at which he was extreme angry. He went into the Kitchin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Inn, where every body repeated what the Comedians had before ſaid to him, which ſeconded likewiſe by the ſtrangers who having along Journey to go that day, had made themſelves ready very early. They invited the Comedians to Breakfaſt with them, where every man drank poor ſick <hi>Ragotins</hi> health, who inſtead of returning their civilities, went ſnarling away, to the Chirurgeon of the Town, to whom he rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his malady. The Chirurgion diſcourſed of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60933:150"/>the cauſe and the effect of his ſwelling Diſeaſe which he underſtood as little as the <hi>Algebra,</hi> and talked to him a quarter of an hour in his terms of Art, which were no more to the purpoſe of that ſubject, then if he had talked of <hi>Preſter-John. Ragotin</hi> grew impatient, and ſwearing admirably for a little man, asked him, whether he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to ſay. The Chirurgeon would have continued his prating; and <hi>Ragotin</hi> would needs beat him, and had done ſo, if he had not humbled himſelf before his impatient patient, from whom he drew three Sawcers full of blood, and applied Cupping-glaſſes to his Shoulders at all adventure. The Cure was no ſooner done, when <hi>Leander</hi> came, and told him that if he would promiſe him not to be angry, he would diſcover a piece of Roguery that had been practiſed againſt him. He promiſed more then the other deſired, and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon his eternal damnation to obſerve all he had promiſed. <hi>Leander</hi> told him, he would witneſs to what he ſwore, and ſo led him home to the Inn, where in the preſence of all, both Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Servants, he made him ſwear afreſh, and then declared how they had uſed his Cloaths. <hi>Ragotin</hi> did at the firſt grow red with ſhame, and was going to break his execrable Oaths, when ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight of them did put him in mind of the danger he ran, with ſo much vehemence, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſwore heartily, there were none could underſtand him. He left ſpeaking; but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ceaſed not from bawling in his Ears, ſo loud, and long, that the poor man thought he ſhould have loſt his hearing. In fine, he came off
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60933:151"/>better then they expected, and began to ſing with all his might, any Song that came firſt to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, which converted their clamorous ſpeaking into a greater ſhout of laughter, which was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, not only from the gazing Servants in that place, but thorow all the Rooms of the Inn, to which different occaſions had called in a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Company. Whilſt the Eccho's of ſo much laughter does by little and little vaniſh in the air, the faithful Chronologiſt ends this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Chapter, with the leave of the Courteous or Diſcourteous Reader, or what ever he be that ſhall be ſo fond as to read this Story.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THe Coach which had a good days journey to make, was ready very early. The ſeven Paſſengers who filled it to purpoſe, ſtowed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in: they drove away, and within ten paces of the Inn the Axletree broke in the midſt. The Coach man curſed his life; they railed at him as if he had been reſponſable for the laſting of an Axletree. They were forced to come out of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60933:151"/>Coach, and return the ſame way to the Inn. The Inhabitants of the maimed Coach were very much perplexed when they were told, that in all that Country there was no Coach nor Cart-maker nearer then three Leagues off that place at a great Town. They held counſel but could determine nothing knowing the Coach would not be able to fowl again till the next day. <hi>Bouvillon</hi> who ſtill held a high commanding hand over her Son, becauſe all the wealth of that Family came by her, enjoyned him to mount a Horſe that carried their Groom, and made his Wife get on another, to give a viſit to an old Uncle of hers, who was the Reverend Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of the ſame Village, where the Coach men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der dwelt. The Lord of that place was of Kin to the Counſellor, and an acquaintance of the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates: They took a fancy to go and wait on him, for Companies ſake. The Hoſteſs furniſhed them with Hackneys, which ſhe made them pay a little dear for, and thus <hi>Bonvillon</hi> only of all that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany remained behind at the Inn, being ſomewhat tired, or pretending to be ſo, beſides that her round bulk could not with ſafety have been carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on an Aſſe, had they found one ſtrong enough to have travelled with ſuch a weighty burthen. She ſent her Maid to <hi>Deſtiny</hi> to invite him to Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with her, and while that was making ready, ſhe new dreſſed her head, friſled and powdred her Locks, put on a laced Apron &amp; Whisk, with a very rich point under it, which was the Brides Pinner. She likewiſe took one of her Daughters beſt Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats out of the bundle, and arrayed her ſelf; in fine, ſhe transformed her ſelf to a pretty little

He knew not what to ſay being naturally very ſilent: but as for <hi>Bouvillon</hi> ſhe was too ingenuous to want matter for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. When ſuch perſons as are very talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, meet alone with thoſe that ſpeak little, and ſeldom replies to what they chatter, they do but ſpeak the more; for judging of others by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and finding they do not anſwer to what they ſay, as they would do on the like occaſion, they believe they have not twattled enough to pleaſe their indifferent Auditor, and ſo they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the Diſcourſe and mean to repair the firſt weakneſs, which moſt commonly is leſs conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the addition, yet will they never give over whilſt any attention is given. One might avoid ſuch a larum indeed; but becauſe there are ſuch infatigable Babblers, as will even continue to talk to themſelves if left alone, after that ſpirit has been once raiſed, or that weight once drawn up in Company. I think the beſt way to deal with them were, to ſpeak as loud, as faſt, and as much as
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60933:152"/>they, if not more. For all the world cannot ſtop this torrent of noiſe which a great talker makes when another ſilently lends him an ear, and does not joyn words with him. This reflexion I can make good by many Experiments, nor do I know whether I my ſelf am not one of thoſe I now Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterize. For the imcomparable <hi>Bouvillon,</hi> ſhe was the greateſt Diſcourſer of nothing that ever was: and ſhe would not only talk to her ſelf, but ſhe would anſwer her ſelf likewiſe. <hi>Deſtiny's</hi> Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iturnity giving her full ſcope, and having a deſign to pleaſe him with her Verbal entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe took her full ſwinge. She related to him all the paſſages and intrigues of the Town of <hi>Laval</hi> where ſhe dwelt; recounted the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſtory, and defamed no particular perſon, or whole Family, from whoſe diſ-repute ſhe did not draw ſome commendations to her ſelf; proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at every deffect which ſhe ſcored on their accounts, that although ſhe knew ſhe was frail her ſelf, yet was ſhe not guilty of ſuch a one, nor ſuch a one. <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> was very much morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at the beginning, and returned not a ſyllable; but at length, he thought himſelf obliged to ſmile now and then, and to tell her ſometimes; That's very pleaſant; This is very ſtrange, and moſt commonly he ſpoke by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. They took away the diſhes, when <hi>Deſtiny</hi> had done eating and all being diſſerved. Madam <hi>Bouvillon</hi> made him ſet down by her at the foot of the bed, and her Maid who had turned out all the reſt of the waiters belonging to the Inn, going af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them her ſelf; ſhut the Chamber door as ſhe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60933:153"/>went forth. <hi>Bouvillon,</hi> who thought perhaps that <hi>Deſtiny</hi> had taken notice of it, ſaid; ſee this hair-brain'd maid, how ſhe hath ſhut us in. I will go and open it if you pleaſe, ſaid <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> I do not ſpeak of that ſaid <hi>Bouvillon</hi> ſtopping him: but you know that two being locked in together, as we may do what we pleaſe, ſo may others believe what they have a mind to of it. It is not of ſuch as you, that people judge raſhly, replyed <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny</hi> to her. I believe that, ſaid <hi>Bouvillon,</hi> but you know we cannot be too cautious of ſuch dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tongues. They muſt have ſome ground though, added <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> and as for your ſelf and I, the inequality betwixt a poor Comedian, and a perſon of your quality is guard enough. But will you have me open the door then continued he. That is not it, ſaid ſhe, bolting it her ſelf, for perhaps none will take notice whether it be ſhut or not, but whether they do or not, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make it paſt opening, then to leave it at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Having ſecured it, ſhe approached <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> her great viſage much enflamed, and her little eyes ſparkling notably, which made him bethink him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf how he ſhould retreat honorably, or avoid without ſhame, that battle which he thought ſhe was ready to give him. This Fat ſenſual Lady pulled off her Neck-handkerchief, and expoſed to <hi>Deſtiny's</hi> ſight, which was not very tempting or pleaſing to him; ten pound weight of Breſts at leaſt, that is to ſay, a third part of her Duggs, the reſt being equally ſtowed under her arm-pits. Her evil deſign, making her bluſh, (for they bluſh likewiſe thoſe ſhameleſs ones ſometimes) her neck
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60933:153"/>was no leſs Red then her Cheeks, and both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at a convenient diſtance might have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a Scarlet Riding-hood. <hi>Deſtiny</hi> bluſhed likewiſe: but his was out of modeſty, whereas <hi>Bouvillon</hi> who had none left, bluſhed for, you may gueſs what. She told him ſhe felt ſomething creeping down her back, and ſhrugging her ſelf in her harneſs, as when ſomething itches, ſhe intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Deſtiny</hi> to put down his hand. The poor youth did it trembling, and the mean while <hi>Bouvillon</hi> feeling his waſt betwixt his Doublet and Breeches, asked him, whether he were not tickliſh? He muſt now have fought it out, or ſurrendred, when <hi>Ragotin</hi> made a Noiſe at the door, beating againſt it with his Hands and Feet, as if he would have broke it down, and calling to <hi>Deſtiny</hi> to open quickly. <hi>Deſtiny</hi> plucked his hand out from <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villons</hi> ſweaty back, to let in <hi>Ragotin,</hi> who ſtill made a deviliſh n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She cried out ſhe was dead; The little Ruſtick did not make her the leaſt excuſe, but leaping and repeating <hi>Madam</hi> Angelica <hi>is found again, Madam</hi> Angelica <hi>is here;</hi> made <hi>Deſtiny</hi> almoſt angry, who
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60933:154"/>called <hi>Bouvillons</hi> Maid as loud as he could, to come to her Miſtreſſes aid, and could hardly be heard by reaſon of the terrible great noiſe, which little <hi>Ragotin</hi> made. The Wench brought at length ſome water and a clean Napkin. <hi>Deſtiny</hi> and ſhe repaired the breach or hurt that was done to the Lady by flinging open the door, and whatever im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience he was in to know, whether <hi>Deſtiny</hi> ſpake true, yet he did not follow his paſſion; nor would he leave <hi>Bouvillon</hi> before her face was waſhed and dried, and her fore-head bound up, often calling <hi>Ragotin</hi> hair-brain'd, who for all that, would not ceaſe halling him, to go whither he had a mind to Conduct him.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IT was true, that Madam <hi>Angelica</hi> was newly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, being Conducted by <hi>Leanders</hi> Servant, which Servant had wit enough not to diſcover that <hi>Leander</hi> was his Maſter, and Madam <hi>Angelica</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſome wonder to ſee him ſo well clad, and did that out of Diſcretion, which <hi>Rancour</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live</hi> did out of Ignorance. <hi>Leander</hi> asked Madam <hi>Angelica,</hi> and his own Servant, whom he diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled as one of his acquaintance or friends, how he
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60933:154"/>had found her out, when <hi>Ragotin</hi> came into the Room leading in <hi>Deſtiny</hi> as in Triumph, or rather training him after him, becauſe he went not faſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to his hot apprehenſion. <hi>Deſtiny</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi> embraced with great teſtimonies of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and with that tenderneſs, which is reſented by thoſe that love, when after a long abſence, or where they had loſt all hopes of ever ſeeing one another again, they happen to meet by ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected adventure. <hi>Leander</hi> and ſhe entertained each other but only with their mutual looks, whereby they expreſſed a great deal, omitting the reſt till a more convenient enterview. Mean time, <hi>Leanders</hi> Servant began his Narration, and told his Maſter, as if he had ſpoken to a Friend, That after he had left him to follow <hi>Angelica's</hi> Raviſhers, as he had conjured him, he did not looſe ſight of them till night, and then the next morning at the entrance into a Wood, he was amazed to find <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi> alone on foot, and all in tears; and added, that having told her, he was <hi>Leanders</hi> Friend, and had purſued her on his behalf, ſhe was very joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and beſeeched him to Conduct her to <hi>Manſe,</hi> or to the place where <hi>Leander</hi> was, if he knew where to find him. It belongs to you Madam, ſaid he, to relate how thoſe that had forced you away, then left you: for I durſt not inquire of you, finding you ſo deeply afflicted, all the time I waited on you, that I feared your ſighs and moans would have broke your heart. The leaſt concerned, were greatly impatient to learn from her own mouth, an adventure which appeared ſo ſtrange to them. For what could any one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60933:155"/>of a young Woman hurried away ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, and then forſaken or abandoned ſo quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without being compelled thereto? Madam <hi>Angelica</hi> intreated that ſhe might go to bed; but the Inn being taken up already, the good Curate got her a Chamber at his Siſters who dwelt the next door, and was then the Widdow of one of the richeſt Farmers in that Country. <hi>Angelica,</hi> did not ſo much want ſleep, as reſt; wherefore <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny</hi> and <hi>Leander</hi> went to viſit her as ſoon as they were informed ſhe was in her bed: Although ſhe were glad that <hi>Deſtiny</hi> was made a confident of her Amour, yet could ſhe not behold him without a bluſh. <hi>Deſtiny</hi> pitied her confuſion, and to divert her from ſhaping any excuſes, courted her to give them an account of what the fellow that came with her had no knowledge of, which ſhe did in this manner. You may gueſs what a ſurprize my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and my ſelf was in, when walking in the Park belonging to that Houſe we were at, we ſaw a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle back-door open towards the Fields, and four or five men running towards us, who ſeized upon me, without ſcarce looking on my Mother, and dragged me half dead through fear to the place where their Horſes ſtood ready. My Mother whom you know to be one of the moſt reſolute Women in the world, furiouſly aſſaulted the firſt ſhe could light upon, and uſed him ſo courſly, that not being able to get himſelf free, he was forced to call his Companions for aſſiſtance. He that relieved him, and was ſo barbarous as to beat my Mother, as I heard him brag upon the way, was the Author of the enterprize. He came not
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60933:155"/>near me, ſo long as the night laſted, during which time, we marched like thoſe that fly and are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued. Had we paſt through any places inhabited, my cries were loud enough to have cauſed them to be ſtopt; but they avoided all ſuch Roads as much as they poſſibly could, only one little Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let they were conſtrained to ride by, where I awaked all the Inhabitants with my noiſe. The day appeared, my Raviſher came near me, and had no ſooner looked upon my face, but giving a great Whoop, he aſſembled his Companions, and held a counſel with them, which laſted in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion about half an hour. My Raviſher appeared as much enraged, as I was afflicted; He ſwore ſo deſperately as ſtartled them all, and quarrelled with moſt of them. In fine, their tumultuous counſel ended, and I know not what they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. They began their march again, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be treated with leſs reſpect then I had been. They were very angry with me, every time I bemoaned my condition, and made many imprecations as if I had done them great wrong. They had torn me away as you know with the cloaths I acted in, and to conceal it, had put one of their coats over it. They met a man upon the way, of whom they inquired ſomewhat. I was much amazed to find it was <hi>Leander,</hi> and I believe he admired no leſs to ſee me, whom he knew, as ſoon as I made him ſee my cloaths, which were not unknown to him, and which I diſcovered at the ſame inſtant that he was gazing on my face. He may have told you how he behaved himſelf. For my part ſeeing ſo many drawn Swords, I
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60933:156"/>fainted in his arms that held me on Horſe-back, and when I had recovered my ſpirits again, I found we purſued our way, but could not find <hi>Leander</hi> in the Company. My ſhreeks re-doubled, and my Raviſhers, whereof one was wounded, took their way through the Fields, and made a halt yeſterday in a Village, where they quartered as Souldiers. This morning at the entrance of a wood, they met a man that was Conducting a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. They unmasked her, knew her, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the like joy of ſuch as have found what they ſought for, hurried her away, after they had miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed him that Conducted her. This Lady cryed out as much as I had done before, and my thought her Voice was no ſtranger to my ear. We had gotten above fifty paces within the Wood, when he whom as I told you, ſeemed to command the reſt, approaching near the fellow that carried me, and ſpeaking of me, ſaid, <hi>Set that bauling thing down.</hi> He was obeyed; they left me, haſtned out of my view, and I was left alone, and a foot. The fright I was in, knowing my ſelf to be alone was enough to have killed me, if he that brought me back hither, and had followed us afar off as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed you, had not come to me. The reſt you know. But, continued ſhe, addreſſing her ſpeech to <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> I think I ought to tell you, that the Woman, they thus prefered before me, reſembles your Siſter, my Companion; hath the ſame Voice, yet I know not what to think; for the man that was with her, is very like the Servant you took after <hi>Leander</hi> quitted you, nor can I put it out of my thoughts, but it was he.

He went to him, and left <hi>Leander</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> together, who had thus the liberty of entertaining each other, after a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome abſence, diſcovering what fears and troubles their hearts reſented all that while. I doubt not, but it would have been very pleaſant to have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard them, but it was the better for them that their enterview was ſo ſecret. In the interim, <hi>Deſtiny</hi> demanded of <hi>Garouffiere</hi> what the buſineſs was? Do you know a Gentleman named <hi>Verville,</hi> and is he a Friend of yours, ſaid <hi>Garouffiere?</hi> He is a perſon to whom I am the moſt obliged, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the moſt in the world, and I believe he does not hate me, ſaid <hi>Destiny.</hi> I think ſo indeed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Garouffiere:</hi> I ſaw him to day at the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans

He alighted therefore at a pitiful Inn, from whence he diſpatched a little youth to tell <hi>Verville</hi> that the

They ſet forth at the hour appointed, and during three Leagues riding, told each other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particulars they had not time to Diſcourſe of before. <hi>Verville</hi> placed <hi>Deſtiny</hi> at a Servants, who was married in the Town, and had a little Houſe very convenient, within five hundred paces of the Caſtle belonging to the Baron of <hi>Arques.</hi> He gave order that he ſhould be kept privately, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60933:158"/>promiſed him to come ſuddenly again to ſee him. <hi>Verville</hi> had not left him above two hours, before he returned, and ſaid at his coming that he had a great many things to tell him. <hi>Deſtiny</hi> grew pale, and was afflicted at his firſt words, and the other as readily gave him hopes of a remedy for the trouble he was to relate, alighted from my horſe, ſaid he, I beheld <hi>Saldaigne,</hi> carried betwixt four, into a lower Chamber. His horſe threw him and fell on him, about a League from hence, and hath much bruiſed him, he told me he had ſomething to ſay to me, and intreated me to follow him into the Chamber as ſoon as a Chirurgion who was there, had ſeen his leg which is much ſtrained with his fall. When we were alone: I muſt ever, ſaid he, reveal all my faults to you, although you are the leaſt indulgent of my cenſurers, your Wiſdom ever chiding my Folly. After this he confeſſed to me, that he had ſtollen away a Comedian, of whom he had a long time been enamoured, and ſaid he would tell me ſome particulars of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize which would raiſe my wonder. He told me that Gentleman, whom I informed you to be his friend, had not been able to find any place of retreat for him in the whole Province, and was obliged to leave him, and carry off thoſe men he had furniſhed him withall to execute his deſign, becauſe one of his Brothers, who uſed to make a conveyance of prohibited Salt, was way-laid by the Searchers, and ſo ſtood in want of ſome aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to ſecure him.

He ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me whether I could not ſpare him ſome others beſides my own Servant, for as raſh as he is, he apprehends it very difficult to carry a Woman far againſt her will: For my part, I made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the undertaking was very eaſie: which he ſoon credited, as Fools do ever hope things will ſucceed according to their wiſhes. His Servants do not know you, and mine is very crafty, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faithful to me. I will make him tell <hi>Saldaigne</hi> that he can get a very ſtout friend of his, which ſhall be your ſelf; your Miſtreſs ſhall have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, and this night wherein they intend to make a long journey, ſhe ſhall feign her ſelf ſick at the firſt place they come to. My man, ſhall endeavour to Fuddle the other two, which is very eaſie, and this ſhall make it very opportune for you to convey away the Damoſel, and making the two Drunkards believe that you are already gone after her, he ſhall lead them a quite contrary Road, and ſo be ſure not to interrupt you. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny</hi> found a great deal of probability in what <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> propoſed, whoſe truſty Servant came at the ſame time into the Chamber, they conſulted together what was to be done. <hi>Verville</hi> kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

The Night came on; <hi>Deſtiny</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the places aſſigned with <hi>Vervilles</hi> man, <hi>Saldaignes</hi> two Servants failed not, and <hi>Verville</hi> did himſelf put Madam <hi>Star</hi> into their hands. Imagine the joy of two young Lovers, who had as much affection as hearts can hold, and the conſtraint they were in, being hindred from expreſſing their minds. Within half a League of that place, <hi>Star</hi> begins to complain; they bid her take courage till they came to a Town two Leagues diſtant, where they put her in hopes ſhe ſhould bait. She feigns that her malady encreaſeth ſtill, <hi>Vervilles</hi> Servant and <hi>Deſtiny</hi> ſeemed to be much concerned, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to prepare <hi>Saldaignes</hi> Servants not to think it ſtrange that they ſhould make a ſtop ſo near the place they came from. In fine, they came to the Town, and demanded lodging at the Inn, which they happily found to be full of Lodgers and Drinkers. Madam <hi>Star</hi> acted the ſick Womans part better by Candle light then ſhe had done in the dark: She lay down in her Cloaths, and deſired they would let her reſt only one hour, and made them believe that after ſhe thought ſhe might be able to ride again. <hi>Saldaignes</hi> men, being Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, did let <hi>Vervilles</hi> do what he pleaſed, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed commanded to take the ſole charge upon him, they Club immediately with four or

                  <p> The Judge of his own Cauſe.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN <hi>Africa,</hi> amongſt certain little Rocks, borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Sea, which are not diſtant from the great City of <hi>Fez</hi> above an hours riding. Prince <hi>Mulei</hi> Son of the King of <hi>Marocco</hi> was left alone, in the night time, having loſt his way in hunting. The skie was not ſpotted with the leaſt cloud; the Sea ſmooth, which the Moon and Stars made it bright: in fine, it was one of thoſe fair nights uſual in thoſe hotter Climates which are far more pleaſant then the faireſt days in our colder Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. The <hi>Marocan</hi> Prince gallopping along the <hi>Strand,</hi> divertiſed himſelf in beholding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of the Moon and leſſer lamps of Heaven on the ſurface of the Waves, as in a Looking-glaſs, when a mournful out-cry invaded his ears, and inſpired him with the curioſity of going to the place whence he gueſſed it to proceed. He ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Horſe, which ſhall be, if you pleaſe a Barbe, and found between ſome of thoſe Rocks, a Woman, who defended her ſelf all ſhe was able, againſt a man that ſtruggled to tie her hands, whilſt another woman was indeavouring to ſtop her mouth with a linen cloth. The young Princes arrival hindred thoſe who offered this violence
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60933:164"/>from proſecuting it, and afforded ſome reſpect to the party they handled ſo roughly. <hi>Mulei</hi> asked her what might be the cauſe of her crying out, and the others what it was they were doing to her? But inſtead of a fair anſwer, the man goes boldly up to him with his drawn Cymitar, and made ſuch a blow at him, as might have dangerouſly wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, had he not avoided it by the nimbleneſs of his horſe. Raſcall, ſayes <hi>Mulei</hi> to him, dareſt thou make an aſſault upon the Prince of <hi>Fez?</hi> I knew thee very well to be ſuch, replyed the <hi>Moor,</hi> but it is becauſe thou art my Prince, and haſt the power to puniſh me, that I muſt either take away thy life, or pay down my own.</p>
               <p>Having told him this, he flew upon <hi>Mulei,</hi> with ſo much fury, that the Prince, though exceeding valiant, was reduced to put himſelf into a poſture, not ſo much of aſſaulting, as defending his own perſon againſt ſo dangerous and bold an Enemy. The two Women in the mean time were hotly engaged, and ſhe who a moment before gave her ſelf up for loſt, kept the other from running away, as if it were above all doubt that her defender muſt be Victorious. Diſpair heightens courage, nay ſometimes enables thoſe that have the leaſt portion of it, although the Princes Valour were incomparably greater then his Adverſaries, and was ſeconded by an addreſs and vigour more then common, the puniſhment which the <hi>Moors</hi> crime made him Judge he deſerved, made him hazard all, and lent him ſo much fury and ſtrength, that the victory hung a long while doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully betwixt the Prince and him: but Heaven
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60933:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>which commonly protects thoſe it raiſes above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, moſt happily guided the Princes followers thither, within hearing of the noiſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants made, and the Womens cries. They ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to them, and came in juſt when their Maſter having the advantage of his fierce opponant had tumbled him on the ground, where he would not kill him, but reſerve him to an exemplary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He forbad his people to do any other to him, ſave only to bind him to a Horſes tail in ſuch manner, that he could neither miſchief him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor any that approached him. Two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen carried the Women behind them, and in this Equipage <hi>Mulei</hi> and his retinue arrived at <hi>Fez</hi> juſt at the break of day. This young Prince commanded as abſolutely in <hi>Fez,</hi> as if he had been King already. He ordered the <hi>Moor</hi> to be brought before him, who was called <hi>Amet,</hi> and the Son of one of the wealthieſt inhabitants of <hi>Fez.</hi> The two Women were known by none, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Moors,</hi> being the moſt jealous of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, take a ſtrict care to conceal their Wives and Slaves from the worlds eye. The woman whom the Prince had reſcued, ſurprized both him and the whole Court with her tranſcendent beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Superiour to all that had been ſeen in <hi>Africk,</hi> and her majeſtick air, not to be hid from their prying eyes by her mean ſlaviſh habit. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther woman was clad, as the reſt of that Country are, whoſe quality allows them a diſtinction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Rabble, and might have paſſed for hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, though not equal to the firſt; but could ſhe have ſtood in competition with the others
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60933:165"/>beauty, yet a paleneſs, which her fear had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, invaded and allayed the luſter of it as much, as the others was heightned with a beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming bluſh that over-ſpread her modeſt cheeks. The <hi>Moor</hi> appeared before <hi>Mulei</hi> with the deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed countenance of a guilty wretch, and faſtned his looks ſtill on the ground. <hi>Mulei</hi> commanded him to declare his crime himſelf, unleſs he would die in torment. I know what is prepared for me, and what I have deſerved, replied he very boldly, and were it any advantage not to diſcover it, there is no torture ſhould force it from me: But I cannot avoid my death, ſince I would have given it thee, and I confeſs the rage I feel for having miſſed my purpoſe of deſtroying thee, torments me more then all the exquiſite pains the Executioners can either invent or inflict upon me. Theſe Spaniſh women, purſued he, were my Slaves; the one of them made the beſt of her Fortune by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance to marry my Brother <hi>Zaides;</hi> the other would never alter her Religion, nor ſhew the leaſt good nature in any return of kindneſs for the love I cheriſhed for her; He would diſcover no more how ſharply ſoever they threatned him. <hi>Mulei,</hi> commanded him to be caſt into a Dungeon loaden with chains. <hi>Zaides Renegado</hi> Wife was thruſt into another Priſon, and the beautiful ſlave was conducted to a <hi>Moors</hi> houſe named <hi>Zulema,</hi> a perſon of Quality, originally a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who had quitted that Country, becauſe he could not be perſwaded to become a Chriſtan. He was deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Illuſtrious Family of <hi>Zegris,</hi> otherwhile ſo famous in <hi>Granado,</hi> whoſe Wife <hi>Zoraida</hi> of the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60933:165"/>ſame houſe, held the repute to be one of the faireſt women in <hi>Fez,</hi> and of a judgment as tranſcendent as her beauty. She was at the firſt ſight of her even charmed with the beauty of the Chriſtian ſlave, and after ſome hours converſation no leſs taken with her wit. Had this rare Chriſtian been capable of any conſolation, ſhe had met it in the careſſes ſhe received from <hi>Zoraida;</hi> but as if ſhe ſhunned whatever might aſſwage her ſorrow, ſhe was never pleaſed but when alone, that ſhe might ſwell her griefs; and when ſhe was with <hi>Zoraida,</hi> it was not without much violence that ſhe withheld her ſighs and tears ſo long Prince <hi>Mulei</hi> had an extreme deſire to be acquainted with her ſtory. This he had told <hi>Zulema,</hi> and as he conceal'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from him, he had alſo confeſſed that he found himſelf inclined to love her, and would have owned it to her, had not the great affliction which yet was legible in her countenance, made him ſuſpect he might have ſome ſuch unknown rival in <hi>Spain,</hi> who tho abſent, might yet hinder him from obtaining the happineſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> he deſired of her, even in a place where he was abſolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. <hi>Zulema</hi> therefore gave his Wife order to enquire into the particulars of the Chriſtians life, and by what accident ſhe was become a ſlave to <hi>Amet. Zoraida</hi> had as great a curioſity to know it as the Prince, and found no great difficulty in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſing the Spaniſh ſlave to ſatisfie her, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved ſhe could not reaſonably deny any thing to her, who paid her ſo many marks and teſtimonies of tenderneſs and amity. She aſſured <hi>Zoraida,</hi> ſhe would anſwer her curioſity when ſhe pleaſed;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60933:166"/>though having nothing but Misfortunes to relate, ſhe feared the ſtory would appear too melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for her entertainment. You will find it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, replies <hi>Zoraida,</hi> by the attention I ſhall give to it, and the intereſt I ſhall have in it, will ſoon create a belief that you could never truſt thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets with any one that hath a truer affection for you. She gently embraced her, after this civil expreſſion, conjuring her not to delay any longer what ſhe ſo much deſired to be ſatisfied in. They were alone, and the fair ſlave having wiped off thoſe tears which the remembrance of her unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs had called into her eyes, ſhe began the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal as follows.</p>
               <p>My name is <hi>Sophia,</hi> I am a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> born at <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia,</hi> and brought up with all the care, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality and Wealth, as were my Father and Mother, are wont to have for a Daughter who was the firſt fruits of their happy Marriage, and whoſe early youth appeared worthy of their choiceſt affection. I had a Brother younger then my ſelf by a year, as lovely as was poſſible; he loved me as tenderly as I loved him, which mutual Friendſhip encreaſed to that degree, that when ever we were aſunder, ſo great a ſadneſs dwelt upon our countenances, that the moſt charming Divertiſements which are wont to delight perſons of our age could not diſperſe it. They would not therefore part us; we learned together all thoſe things, which are uſually taught children, of good Families, of either Sex, and ſo it hapned to all the worlds aſtoniſhment, that I was no leſs dextrous then he in all the violent exerciſes of a Cavalier,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60933:166"/>and he no leſs accompliſhed in whatſoever is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for Ladies of Quality to be skilled in. This extraordinary way of Education begot an infinite deſire, in a Gentleman acquainted with my Father, to have his children bred with us. He propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to my Parents, who gave conſent, and the nearneſs of our dwelling facilitated the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns on either hand: This Gentleman equalled my Father in Wealth, and was not inferiour to him in Nobility. He likewiſe had but one Son and a Daughter, much of the like Age with my Brother and my ſelf, inſomuch that it was not doubted by all the City, but theſe two Families would be one day united together by a double Marriage. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> and <hi>Lucia,</hi> (theſe were the names of the Brother and Siſter) were equally amiable; my Brother loved <hi>Lucia,</hi> and was reciprocally belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved again: <hi>Don Carlos</hi> loved me, and I him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Our Parents were acquainted with it, and were ſo far from prohibiting it, that had not our greener Age hindred, they would not have defer'd our Marriage then; But the happy progreſs of our innocent affections was diſturbed by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature death of my noble Brother, a violent Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cut him off in eight dayes time, and this was the firſt of my Misfortunes. <hi>Lucia</hi> was ſo afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that no perſwaſions could keep her from devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her ſelf a Nun. I was ſick unto death, and <hi>Don Carlos</hi> ſo overcome with ſadneſs, his Father had reaſon to fear he might ſhortly be left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iſſue, ſo ſenſibly the loſs of my dear Brother whom he doted on, the danger I was in, and the reſolution his Siſter had taken wrought their dire

The firſt was concluded, the other was deſtroyed. The <hi>Italian</hi> Count, who about that time fell in love with you, whoſe Wealth and Quality were as great baits to your
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60933:171"/>Father, as his ill Meen &amp; more unhandſome quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were ſcare-crows to you, procur'd me at leaſt the pleaſure to ſee you countermined in your love; and then flattered my ſoul with thoſe fond hopes which every little change breeds in unhapy minds. In fine, your Father, preferred the ſtranger you did not love, to him you lov'd more then your ſelf. I beheld him who had made me unfortunate, plung'd into a greater misfortune himſelf, and that Rival I had ſo much averſion for, thrown from her higheſt hopes into a worſe condition then my own, becauſe I loſt nothing in him in whom I never could get any intereſt; but you loſt all in <hi>Don Carlos</hi> who was yours intirely, which loſs moreover, though it were very great, was yet far leſs conſiderable, then to become a Subject to that eternal Tyrant, whom you could never fancy in the leaſt. But this Muſhroom proſperity, or to ſay better, this vain imagined hope, ſoon wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered again. I underſtood by <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> that you were reſolved to follow him, and was my ſelf imployed to ſee all things in readineſs for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to convey you to <hi>Barcellona,</hi> and from thence to <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Italy.</hi> All the ſtrength and patience I was till then endued with to ſupport my Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, left me at once at this ſtrange reſolution, which was ſo much the more amazing, as it was unexpected that ever it could have been put in practice. I was afflicted even to ſickneſs, and ſuch a ſickneſs as confined me to my bed. One day as I was bemoaning my ſelf of my cruel Fate, when my belief that no body was near enough to over-hear, made me as earneſt and loud as if I had
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60933:172"/>ſpoken to ſome confident of my Amours, I ſaw the <hi>Moor Amet</hi> appearing before me, who had liſtned to my Diſcourſe, and who after he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me time enough to recollect my ſelf from the diſturbance he had put me into, ſpake thus to me.</p>
               <p>I know thee <hi>Claudia,</hi> and that even before thou hadſt diſguiſed thy Sex, to ſerve <hi>Don Carlos</hi> as a Page; and the reaſon why I never diſcovered that I knew thee, was becauſe I had a deſign on foot as well as thou hadſt. I have now over-heard what deſperate reſolutions thou haſt fixed upon; thou wilt reveal thy ſelf to thy Maſter, and let him know thou art a young Maid, languiſhing for the love of him, yet not expecting any retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of love again, reſolveſt to kill thy ſelf before his face, thereby to deſerve he ſhould at leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret her whom he never would vouchſafe to love. Poor Maid! what canſt thou think to do in mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering thy ſelf, but ſecure <hi>Sophia</hi> the better in the poſſeſſion of her <hi>Don Carlos?</hi> I have better and more happy counſel for thee, if thou beeſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of apprehending me. Deprive thy Rival of her Lover; the way is facile, if you dare believe me, and though it requires ſome more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary reſolution, yet not above what thou haſt ſhown in taking the habit of a man upon thee, which made thee run the hazard of forfeiting thy honour to obtain thy love. Hearken therefore to me with attention, continued the <hi>Moor;</hi> for I will now reveal a ſecret to thee, which I till now did never commit to any truſt but thine, and if the deſign I ſhall now propound, be not both rational and pleaſing, it depends on you to follow, or to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60933:172"/>ſlight it. I am of <hi>Fez,</hi> a perſon of Quality in my own Country; my misfortune made me a ſlave to <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> and my inclination ſubjected me as much to <hi>Sophia's</hi> beauty; Thus have I in a few Syllables diſcovered many things of moment. Thou thinkeſt thy miſery above relief, becauſe thy Lover contrives to carry away his Miſtreſs, and convey her to <hi>Barcellona.</hi> This makes both for thy happineſs and mine, if thou wilt take the beſt advantage of this opportunity; I have treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about my ranſome, and paid it down. An <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick Galeot</hi> attends for me in the Road, not far diſtant from the place, where <hi>Don Carlos</hi> hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed another to lie ready at Anchor to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat his deſign. He hath defered his Voyage for a day: let us prevent him with as much diligence as policy. Go and advertiſe <hi>Sophia,</hi> on thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters behalf, that ſhe ſhould prepare her ſelf to go away this night, when thou ſhalt come and give warning of it: Conduct her to my Veſſel, I will tranſport her into <hi>Africk,</hi> and thou ſhalt remain alone in <hi>Valentia</hi> to enjoy thy beloved; who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps would as ſoon have choſen thee as <hi>Sophia,</hi> had he been made acquainted with thy paſſion.</p>
               <p>At theſe laſt words of <hi>Claudia,</hi> I was ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with my juſt grief, that fetching a deep ſigh, I fell into another ſwound, without leaving any the leaſt ſign of life.

               <p>The noiſe made by the Marriners who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the harbour of <hi>Salley,</hi> and the ſhooting of ſome Guns aboard, to which the Town gave anſwer, interrupted the further reproaches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Amet</hi> and <hi>Claudia,</hi> and for a time freed me from the loathed ſight of thoſe two perſons: We went a aſhore; <hi>Claudia</hi> and my ſelf had Veils thrown over our faces, and we were lodged with the perfidious <hi>Amet,</hi> at a <hi>Moors</hi> of his kindred. The next day, we were put into a cloſe Chariot, and driven to <hi>Fez,</hi> whereas <hi>Amet</hi> was welcom'd by his Father with much joy, I went in as the moſt afflicted, and the moſt deſpairing perſon in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60933:173"/>the world. As for <hi>Claudia,</hi> ſhe ſoon provided better for her condition, by renouncing her Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity and eſpouſing <hi>Zaida,</hi> the Brother to the treacherous <hi>Amet.</hi> This wicked wretch omitted no artifice to perſwade me likewiſe to change my belief; and take <hi>Amet</hi> into my Marriage bed, as ſhe had done <hi>Zaida,</hi> and became the greateſt Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to me, even when, they having aſſaid in vain by kindneſs, promiſes and civil treatments to allure me to a compliance; <hi>Amet,</hi> and his people exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed on me all the Barbariſms they could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. I was fain to make uſe of my conſtancy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day in oppoſing ſo great a number of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and then found my ſelf indeed more able to undergo my troubles, then I could have deſired; when I began again to believe that <hi>Claudia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented her having been ſo ſtrangely wicked: In publick ſhe ſeemed to perſecute me with more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimoſity then the reſt, but in private, ſhe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times rendred me ſome good ſervices, vvhich made me look upon her, as one that might poſſibly have proved Vertuous; had ſhe but been Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted accordingly.</p>
               <p>One day, vvhen all the reſt of the Women vvere gone to the publick Baths, as it is the cuſtom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you <hi>Mahometans,</hi> ſhe came and found me vvhere I then vvas, vvith a face compoſe to ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſpake to me in theſe terms.

I can live no longer at this diſtance from <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Chriſtian Continent, vvith infidels, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vvhom, I knovv it is impoſſible to find Salvation either vvhilſt I live, or after I am dead: You may judge of the ſincerity of my repentance, by this ſecret vvhich I novv impart to you, vvhich makes you Miſtreſs of my life; and puts an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity into your hands to retribute all thoſe miſchiefs I have been forced to act againſt you. I have gained fifty Chriſtian ſlaves, the moſt part <hi>Spaniards</hi> to be for me all perſons fit and capable to undertake a great deſign, vvith ſome monies vvhich I have ſecretly furniſhed them vvithall; they have procured a Bark able to carry us all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Spain,</hi> if God vvill proſper ſo good a deſign; It reſts in you, vvhether you vvill follovv me in this enterprize, and ſave your ſelf if I be ſaved, or periſhing vvith me, at leaſt free your ſelf from the Captivity of your cruel enemies, by putting a Period to ſo troubleſome a life; as, novv, yours needs muſt be. Determine therefore, <hi>Sophia,</hi> and vvhile vve cannot be ſuſpected to have any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, reſolve vvithout vvaſting the time, on that vvhich moſt concerns both your liberty and mine.</p>
               <p>I caſt my ſelf at <hi>Claudia's</hi> feet, and judging of hers by my ovvn heart, could not at all diſtruſt the ſincerity of her fair vvords; I thanked her vvith all the povver of expreſſion, and all the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60933:174"/>gratitude of my ſoul; and methoughts this vvas an earneſt of thoſe benefits ſhe would beſtow on me: We appointed the day to take our flight to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea-ſide, where ſhe aſſured me, that cercain little Rocks hid our Veſſel from being ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſcovered. The day which I had promiſed to my ſelf ſhould be ſo happy was now come; We got forth both out of the Houſe and Town very proſperouſly. I admired at the goodneſs of Heaven for the ſafety we met with in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our defign, and gave them hearty thanks for this early ſucceſs; But my troubles were not ſo near their Period as I reckoned. <hi>Claudia</hi> acted only by order of the perfidious <hi>Amet;</hi> and being more perfidious then he, ſhe led me into this ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Creek, in the Evening, only to expoſe me to the violence of the <hi>Moor,</hi> who durſt not make an aſſault upon my chaſtity in his Fathers Houſe, although a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> becauſe he was a very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt moral man.

She therefore thruſt her ſelf amongſt the Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, loſt no opportunity to ſignalize her ſelf, and performed it with ſo much bravery, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour heard of the Fame of the counterfeit <hi>Don Fernand.</hi> It was her happineſs to be near him, when in the heat of a diſpute wherein the Chriſtians were worſted, he fell into an Ambuſcado of <hi>Moors,</hi> was deſerted by his party, and ſurrounded by the infidels; and in all appearance had been ſlain, his horſe being ſo under him, had not our <hi>Amazon</hi> mounted him on hers, and ſeconding his Valour with acts almoſt above belief, given to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians leaſure to rally and come to diſingage that Valiant Emperour, ſo Heroick a piece of ſervice was not unrecompenced.

All the actions of a man were ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to her; her Viſage was ſo fair, and made her appear ſo young; her Courage was ſo admitable in ſo tender an age, and her Wit ſo charming, that hardly any man of Quality or Command in all that crowd, but ſought her friendſhip with eagerneſs.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60933:178"/>was as well received there, as any Cavalier could be by any principal Officer. He diſcovered <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia's</hi> countenance in <hi>Don Fernands</hi> face again, was more ſurprized then at firſt, and that increaſed when he heard a Voice that ſtruck him to the heart with every Syllable, renewing the ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful remembrance of his dear abſent Miſtris, whom he had loved above all the world. <hi>Sophia</hi> ſtill unknown to her Lover, made him eat with her, and afterwards, having cauſed thoſe which attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to withdraw, and giving ſtrict order that none ſhould be admitted, ſhe made him again repeat what he had told her.

They flattered themſelves with the hopes that I might be yet concealed in ſome part of the City with their Daughter, or that at leaſt we were not far frome thence. They hid the knowledge of their loſs from every one but the Vice-Roy, who was of their kindred, and it was ſcarcely day-light when the Officers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice came into my Chamber, and found me aſleep; I was ſurpized at ſuch a Viſit, as much as there was cauſe for it, and when after they had asked me where <hi>Sophia</hi> was, I had made the ſame Queſtion my Anſwer; my Adverſaries were incenſed, and hurried me to Priſon with extream ſeverity. I was examined, and could plead nothing in my own Vindication againſt <hi>Sophia's</hi> Letter; That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced the deſign I had to carry her away, but it was more apparent that my Page vaniſhed at the ſame time with her. <hi>Sophia's</hi> Parents made ſtrict ſearch after her, and my friends likewiſe were no leſs diligent in making diſcovery whither the Page had conveyed her; That was the only means
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60933:180"/>to juſtifie my innocency, but we could never get any intelligence of theſe Fugitive Lovers, which made my enemies accuſe me of being guilty of both their Deaths. In fine, Juſtice ſeconded by Power, carried it againſt oppreſſed innocency; I was informed that I ſhould ſoon be ſentenced, and that it would be to die; I could not hope that Heaven would ſhew any Miracles in my favour, and therefore was reſolved to adventure my own eſcape by an act of deſpair. I clubbed with ſome Bandits, my fellow Priſoners, all reſolute Knaves; ſo we forced the Priſon Gate, and through the aſſiſtance of our friends, we recovered the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains neareſt adjoyning to <hi>Valentia,</hi> before the Vice-Roy could have any notice of it; we kept our ſelves a long time Maſters of the field: <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia's</hi> Infidelity, her Parents eager Perſecution, the unjuſtice I thought the Vice-Roy had done me; and laſtly the loſs of my Eſtate, caſt me into ſo great a deſpair, that I expoſed my life in all the ingagements where my Comrades and my ſelf found any reſiſtance, by which I acquired ſo high a repute amongſt them, that they would needs make me their Leader. This I undertook with ſo great ſucceſs; that our Troop became dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Kingdoms of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Valentia,</hi> we having the inſolence to put thoſe Countries to pay us contribution.

In the end <hi>Baguenodiere</hi> got his hands at liberty; but being cloſſely preſs'd upon by the two Brothers, who flew upon him like Lions, his long arms could not move at will; He would have gone back a little, and ſo ſell upon a man that was behind him, and

Nay, they do much more; for 'tis the Women moſt commonly that make the firſt overtures, and are firſt taken, becauſe they are laſt ſeen by their Gallants, whom they have the opportunity to ſee daily in Churches, Walks, and from their Balcones and Jalouſiers, or Lattic'd Windows. <hi>Dorothea</hi> made her Siſter <hi>Feliciana</hi> acquainted with the converſation ſhe had enjoy'd with <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> and frankly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to her, that this ſtranger had gained more upon her good opinion, then all the Cavaliers of <hi>Sevil;</hi> and her Siſter approved the deſign ſhe had upon his liberty. The two fair Siſters mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralized a long while upon the advantagious pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges which men have above Women, who

For my own part, ſayes <hi>Dorothea</hi> to her. Siſter, I am very certain that love ſhall never be able to ſeduce me to any thing againſt my duty; but I am likewiſe fully reſolved never to marry any man, that does not poſſeſſe in his ſingle perſon, all that I could expect in mankind, for I ſhould much ſooner chuſe to waſte the reſt of my life in a ſolitary Nunnery, then be linked in the uneaſie yoke of Matrimony with a Husband I could no way af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. <hi>Feliciana</hi> told her Siſter, that was her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution too, and they confirmed each others opinion herein, with all the ſtrongeſt Arguments their ingenuity could furniſh them withall upon that Subject. <hi>Dorothea</hi> met with ſome difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in making good the promiſe ſhe had: paſſed to <hi>Don Sancho</hi> of diſcovering her ſelf to him, and ſhewed her Siſter the perplexity ſhe was in; but <hi>Feliciana,</hi> who was happy in finding out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, put her Siſter in mind of a Lady al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied to them, and which was more an intimate friend of theirs, (for all of ones Kindred are not ſuch) that would ſerve her faithfully and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in ſuch a buſineſs as concerned her happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: You know, ſayes this good Siſter, that <hi>Marina,</hi> who hath ſerved us ſo many years, is marryed to a Chirurgeon that lives in a little houſe belonging to our Kinſwoman, and joyning to it, which two Houſes have an Entry common

The Marqueſs in the mean time was obſtinately pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the reſt who fled with all the ſpeed they could make before him as ſoon as ever they ſaw their Compagnons fall. At the other end of the ſtreet <hi>Don Sancho</hi> eſpied ſome people with a light who came out at the noiſe they had made; He was afraid it might be ſome Officer of Juſtice, and it proved ſo: He retreated into the ſtreet where the fight firſt began; and from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, where in the midſt of it he met hand to hand with an ancient Gentleman that had a light, and his Sword drawn upon the noiſe <hi>Don Sancho</hi> made with his running towards him. This was old <hi>Don Manuel,</hi> who came from ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at a Neighbours houſe, as he uſually did every night, and was going in at his Garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door not far from the place were he met <hi>Don Sancho;</hi> He asked our Cavalier, who goes there? A man, replied <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> whom it concerns to be gone quickly unleſs you ſtop him: Perhaps, ſaid <hi>Don Manuel,</hi> ſome accident hath befallen you, which may oblige you to ſeek a place of Sanctuary; and if ſo, my houſe being near at hand may do you ſervice; It is true indeed, replied <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> I am indeavouring to ſecure my ſelf from the Juſtices hands, who I doubt are following me, and ſince you are ſo generous as to profer your houſe to a ſtranger, he puts the confidence of his ſafe-guard in your hands, promiſing never to forget the favour,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60933:214"/>not trouble you any longer with his preſence, then till they are paſt that poſſibly hunt for him. <hi>Don Manuel</hi> at this opened the Garden-door with a Key he carried about him, and having cauſed <hi>Don Sancho</hi> to go into the Garden, led him into an Arbour of Lawrels; whilſt he went to take a better order about his concealment in the houſe without any ones knowledge: <hi>Don Sancho</hi> had not been long in the Arbour when he ſaw a Woman coming towards him, who ſaid, follow me Sir, my Miſtreſs <hi>Dorothea</hi> ſtays for you. Theſe words made him gueſs he might be in his Miſtreſſes Garden, and the old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man might be her Father; He ſuſpected <hi>Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi> had aſſigned his Rival to come to the ſame place, and followed <hi>Iſabella,</hi> more tormented with jealouſie then fear of the Juſtice; In the interim, <hi>Don Juan,</hi> came at the appointed time, opened the Garden-door with the Key <hi>Iſabella</hi> left him, and went to the ſame Arbour, which <hi>Don Sancho</hi> had newly forſaken; A moment af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he ſpies a man come to him, puts himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a defenſive poſture in caſe he were aſſaulted, and wondred when he perceived it to be <hi>Don Manuel,</hi> who bid him go along with him, and he would ſecure him in a private Room where no body ſhould find him; <hi>Don Juan</hi> conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his words, that he might have taken one into the Garden that was purſued. He could do no leſs as Affairs then ſtood, but follow him, giving him many thanks for ſo great a Charity; and it may juſtly be believed he was no leſs troubled at the danger he was in, then vexed at
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60933:215"/>this obſtacle which croſſed his amorous deſign <hi>Don Manuel</hi> led him to his own Chamber, and left him there, to get a bed made ready for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſome other: leave we him in the perplexity he needs muſt find himſelf, and let us follow his Brother <hi>Don Sancho de Sylva; Iſabella</hi> Conducts him to a lower Chamber which looked towards the Garden, where <hi>Dorothea</hi> and <hi>Feliciana</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected <hi>Don Juan de Peralta,</hi> the one as a lover who deſired to gain his favour, the other with a reſolution to tell him truly ſhe could not love him; and therefore it were better he ſhould make his Addreſſes to her Siſter. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> entred the Room where the fair Siſters were, who were infinitely ſurprized to behold him; <hi>Dorothea</hi> ſtood Speechleſs, as if death had ceazed on her, and had not her Siſter held her up and placed her in a Chair, ſhe had ſunk on the floor; <hi>Don Sancho</hi> became immoveable, <hi>Iſabella</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt frighted out of her wits; and thought the dead <hi>Don Sancho's</hi> Ghoſt appeared to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of the wrong his Miſtreſs did him: <hi>Felicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> though very much terrified to ſee <hi>Don Sancho</hi> riſen from the Grave again, was yet more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at her Siſters condition, who at length came to her ſelf, and then <hi>Don Sancho</hi> ſpake to her in this manner. If the the Fame of my death, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful <hi>Dorothea!</hi> did not in part excuſe your inconſtancy, the diſpair it puts me into would not allow me ſo much life as to chide you for it; I was willing to keep the world in the falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of my death, that I might be neglected and forgotten by my Enemies, but not by you who
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60933:215"/>had engaged your Soul to love no other but my ſelf, which promiſe you ſo ſoon have broken; I could revenge the injury at full by making ſo much noiſe as ſhould ſoon draw your Father hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and diſcover the perſon you have invited to your Chamber at this ſeaſon, but Fool that I am, I dare not yet diſpleaſe you, being more afflicted that I muſt love you no more then at your having beſtowed your heart elſewhere. Injoy fair faithleſs Lady! Injoy your love! Fear no diſturbance in your New-born paſſion; I ſhall ſoon free you from the perſon who might for ever reproach your treachery towards him, even when he expoſed his own life to wait on you. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> would have withdrawn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf after he had ſaid this, but <hi>Dorothea</hi> ſtopp'd him, and was about to juſtifie her ſelf, when <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> came in haſte and told her <hi>Don Manuel</hi> was coming: <hi>Don Sancho</hi> had only time to ſtep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the door; the old Gentleman was angry with his Daughters for being ſo late up, and whilſt his back was towards the door <hi>Don San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> ſtole ſoftly out, and got into the ſame Arbour where he had been at his firſt coming in, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelf againſt any ſudden attempt, and expecting a fair opportunity to be gone; <hi>Don Manuel</hi> went into his Daughters Chamber for a light to let in the Officers of Juſtice then knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſame Garden-door, as having been informed that <hi>Don Manuel</hi> had let in a man; that probably was one of thoſe ingaged in the Scuffle: <hi>Don Manuel</hi> made no difficulty to open to them that they might ſearch his houſe, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60933:216"/>the party was lock'd up in his own Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which they would never ſuſpect; <hi>Don San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> ſeeing he could not avoid them, came forth of the Lawrel Arbour, and ſtepping to <hi>Don Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> who was much amazed to ſee him, told him in his ear, that a perſon of Honour was always as good as his word, and never forſook thoſe he had once taken into his protection. <hi>Don Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> intreated the Provoſt who was his Friend, to leave <hi>Don Sancho</hi> in his cuſtody: which was eaſily aſſented to; both in reſpect to his Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and becauſe the others wounds were not dangerous; The Officers of the Juſtice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, and <hi>Don Manuel</hi> being confirmed by the repetition of the ſame words he had ſpoken to <hi>Don Sancho</hi> when he firſt met with him, that it was he whom he had taken into his Protection, no longer doubted but the other was ſome Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant brought thither either by his Daughters or <hi>Iſabella.</hi> To diſcover which truth he cauſed <hi>Don Sancho</hi> to go into a Chamber apart, deſiring him to remain there till he returned; He went into the other Room where he had left <hi>Don Juan de Peralto,</hi> a Servant of his was come along with the Officers, and demanded to ſpeak with him; <hi>Don Juan</hi> knew well enough his <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> was very ſick, and not in a condition to make inquiry after him; beſides that, he durſt not have done ſo without his order, though he had known where he was, which he could not: He was therefore hugely troubled at <hi>Don Manuels</hi> words, to whom he ſaid at Random.

There hapn d to be a ram bred up at the Inn, whom the raſcally Boys that went up and down the ſtreets &amp; yard where it frequented, had uſed to make ſport with, by putting both their hands upon his head and provoking him to run at them with his horns, which he would do with all his might, as thoſe animals are naturally inclined; this beaſt had liberty to range over all the houſe at his pleaſure, and came into the Chambers often times, where ſome delighted in feeding him: He was in the Operators at the time they were reading the Novel. He ſpied <hi>Ragotin,</hi> whoſe hat was fallen off from his crown, and who, as I before related, raiſed up and then let fall his head upon his lap. The Ram took him for ſome cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion that thus defied him to try whoſe Scull was hardeſt; He retreated three or four paces back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward like one that is going to take a great leap; and ruſhing forwards like a race horſe, butted his head, armed with horns, moſt fiercely againſt poor <hi>Ragotin,</hi> which was quite bald on the crown.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60933:219"/>He had broken his brain-pain like an Earthen pitcher, no doubt, had not <hi>Ragotin</hi> moſt happily juſt raiſed it up at the inſtant he made his blow, which by this fortune only grazed along his face and battered the ſuperficies of it. This accident did ſo ſurprize the Spectators, that they were put into a kind of extaſie, their laughter only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; Inſomch as the Ram who was taught to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat this ſcurvy trick, had time enough to make a ſecond courſe, which inconſiderately lighted betwixt his knees; at the time when <hi>Ragotin</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed with the blows, and his noſe and batter'd face bleeding in many places, had lifted up his hands to rub his ſmarting eyes, which were both equally bruiſed with the Rams horns, they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to grow juſt at the ſame diſtance from each other at his eyes. This ſecond attaque, ſoon made him open them, and he no ſooner diſcovered that enemy, but ſtriking with his cloſed fiſt upon his head, he hurt his hand moſt grievouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his creſt. This made him terrible mad, and that madneſs encreaſed at the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies laughter, which made him wrangle with all of them, and fling out of the room in a rage; he intended to have gone out of the Inn like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but mine Hoſt ſtopp'd him for the recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which was perhaps as unwelcome to him, as the battery of the Rams horns.</p>
